<H2>Chapter 7: 12 Rounds of Whoop-Ass</H2>

<H3>Round 2</H3>
Katriana (<I>wildshaped</I> into eagle form) folded her wings to dive under the four <A HREF="../r6/index.html#firebats">Fire Bats</A> surrounding her, trying to make it back to the relative safety of the stone platform. She dodged two of the bats but the other two matched her movement and dove in to bite. Flaming jaws latched on, simultaneously burning and dragging the eagle downwards. Katriana nonetheless fought through to the platform and landed. Chaden threw an <I>Orb of Cold</I> at one bat, wounding but not dislodging it.

<P>Seremak launched into a Whirlwind attack against the five closest bats surrounding him. Two were killed outright, with the remaining three severely wounded. Two of those three dove in to bite at the warrior: one was promptly killed by the <I>Fire Shield - Cold</I> which Seremak had cast, the other bat survived and latched on to suck blood. Rai attacked another bat, damaging its wing. Two of the creatures snapped back at the dog, taking damage from the <I>Fire Shield.</I> One managed to latch on, the other was repelled in Grapthar's direction and promptly killed. Another bat bit Chaden, latching on to suck blood.

<P>Nearly forgotten amidst the multitude of bats, the Fire Giant simply smirked. Edwin cast <I>Bigby's Interposing Hand</I> to hamper its boulder throwing.

<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 3</H3>
Of the five bats surrounding Seremak, two had been killed and the other three badly wounded. One of these three decided it had had enough of the <I>Fire Shield</I> and veered off to bite Grapthar instead. It missed, and Seremak's next Whirlwind attack killed it and one of the others. Rai bit one of the bats surrounding him, but the bat bit back (and latched on).

<P>The Fire Giant chucked a boulder at Chaden, but the <I>Bigby's Interposing Hand</I> deflected it harmlessly into the tower wall.

<P>Two of the bats had latched on to Katriana and continued to suck blood. She attempted to knock one off, but could not dislodge it. Grapthar killed the other one. Chaden stabbed the bat latched on to her, also failing to dislodge it. She managed to dodge a second bat.

<P>One of the remaining bats chose an easier target: Edwin. Lacking armor or dexterity bonus, the mage was easily bitten. Edwin ignored the bat, instead casting <I>Fog Cloud</I> centered on the Fire Giant's pile of boulders.

<DIV ID="buffs"><U>Current Buffs:</U><BR>

<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 4</H3>
Both bats attached to Katriana continued to drain blood. She managed to bite one of them, though was still unable to dislodge it. The other bat, apparently sated, released its jaws and flew unsteadily away. Katriana swiped at it as it left, but it dove into the sea of flame.

<P>Seremak, having decimated all of the bats surrounding him, strode over to Chaden to slice at the bat attacking her. He inflicted a great deal of damage, but fell just short of killing it. Rai killed another bat nearby. The Fire Giant managed to hit Chaden with a boulder, bruising her and incidentally killing the bat. Chaden returned fire, landing a critical hit with her bow. Kaerick attempted to blind the giant using <I>Glitterdust,</I> but it resisted the magic. Edwin fired five <I>Magic Missiles</I> at the giant, further wounding it, while Grapthar kindly killed the bat which had latched on to the mage.

<P>The sole remaining bat broke off combat and dove into the sea of fire. Several adventurers noted that it flew to roughly the same place as the first.

<DIV ID="edwin"><U>Edwin's Extensive Edificatory Expositions</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The Fire Bats are native to the Elemental Plane of Fire, where they are considered something of a pest. Their relationship with the other denizens of the plane is akin to the relationship between pigeons and urban dwelling humans on the Prime Material Plane in that they consume vermin but are in turn hunted for sport or to eliminate a nuisance... but I digress.
<BR>&nbsp; Fire Bats are interesting in that, though native to the Elemental Plane they are not composed exclusively of living fire. They have a body composed of tough leathery tissue, which is sheathed in a constant flame. They require sustenance of the blood of living creatures, and once sated reproduce by fission - which is quite rare amongst Fire creatures (though far more common for Earth and Air). The engorged Fire Bat simply splits into two; indeed there are very fine traceries of scar tissue running down its sides where the skin has split and healed. If extinguished they strongly resemble a drowned muskrat with wings. With their flames extinguished their skin secretions also tend to become highly pungent, culminating the the spontaneous re-ignition of their sheathing of flame... but I digress.
<BR>&nbsp; When a Fire Bat is killed its body is entirely consumed by a brief but intense flame. I believe this flare is actually a short-lived gateway to the Elemental Plane of Fire. If a specimen could be captured alive and subjected to alchemical experimentation it might be possible to harness this gate to create a channel to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing one to siphon off a nearly inexhaustible supply of energy ... but I digress.</DIV>

<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 5</H3>
Finally free of the troublesome bats, Katriana flew across the open expanse of fire and cast <I>Summon Nature's Ally,</I> choosing a small Air Elemental. The elemental streaked across the tower to attack the giant, inflicting only minor damage but helpfully drawing its attention. The giant crushed the elemental with a boulder, one which would otherwise have been flung at the adventurers.

<IMG SRC="gravity.gif" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=216 ALT="Side view of Fire and Water" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<P>Edwin attempted to get <A HREF="../r6/index.html#theplan">the plan</A> back on track by using <I>Dimension Door</I> to carry himself plus Seremak, Rai, and Grapthar across the open flames to the center of the far walkway. Unfortunately this just happened to be the exact center of a <I>Reverse Gravity</I> field projecting up to the next level of the tower. The four adventurers fell upwards through a previously unnoticed ten foot foot diameter hole in the ceiling. Seremak immediately cast <I>Feather Fall</I> (which also affected Rai), while Edwin managed to grab on to the edge of the hole to cling to the wall. Grapthar  fell straight up out of sight, with Seremak floating more slowly behind him. Rai managed to land on the ceiling but immediately followed his master down the hole.

<P>Though surprised at the sudden turn of events Chaden and Kaerick continued to shoot arrows at the Fire Giant, inflicting a little more damage with each hit.
<BR CLEAR="RIGHT">

<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 6</H3>
Chaden and Kaerick continued to pepper the giant with arrows, landing several. The giant grew annoyed at this and hurled another boulder. <I>Bigby's Interposing Hand</I> maneuvers to keep itself between the caster and the target, and with Edwin up at the ceiling the hand no longer provided cover for the two archers. Chaden was hit by the boulder, hurting her severely. She ducked back down the staircase to the <A HREF="../r6/index.html">lower level,</A> avoiding further boulders. A moment later Kaerick joined her.

<P>Katriana, still in eagle form, crossed the gravity threshold and smoothly flipped upside down to descend into the hole in the ceiling. She checked on Edwin as she passed, still clinging to the edge of the hole with the help of his weasel familiar Pop. <I>[Editor's note: Pop made a Climbing skill check to Aid Another, granting Edwin +2 on his own roll. Edwin would have fallen without this assistance.]</I> 

<CENTER><IMG ID="scoreboard" SRC="round6.gif" WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=103 ALT="Scoreboard" TITLE="Hit Points Inflicted"><BR><DIV ID="caption">Hit Points Inflicted</DIV></CENTER>




<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 7</H3>
Katriana spiraled down twenty feet before emerging on the next level. If the <A HREF="../r5/index.html#planeofair">first level</A> of the tower resembled the Elemental Plane of Air, the <A HREF="../r6/index.html">second</A> the plane of Earth and the third the plane of Fire, the fourth level clearly represented the Elemental Plane of Water. A large expanse of water surrounded a small island, with a shallow coral reef along one side. Grapthar and Rai were treading water and swimming towards the island, while Seremak thrashed about at the bottom of the small sea. The druid immediately changed back into her human form to dive into the water.

<P>Edwin was not strong enough to climb back up to the ceiling of the fire level, and so continued to cling to the edge of the hole. He managed to invoke <I>Dancing Lights,</I> an innate spell-like ability for Gnomes. This created a glowing humanoid shape to draw the giant's attention, and later Edwin heard the satisfying crack of boulders targeting the phantasm.

<P>Meanwhile Chaden and Kaerick crouched on the staircase. Chaden drank a potion to <I>Cure Light Wounds</I> and Kaerick cast another <I>Cure Light Wounds</I> spell upon her, healing nearly all of the damage from the boulder strike.

<DIV ID="quote" ALIGN=RIGHT>&quot;Is Grapthar wearing plate mail?&quot;<BR>&quot;Yes, but he has a bunch of ranks in Swim.&quot;</DIV>





<HR WIDTH=60%"><A NAME="dinicythis"><H3>Round 8</H3></A>
Katriana caught sight of an enormous (25 foot long) pike-header fish swimming toward her. She identified it as a Dinicythis, a prehistoric predator with jaws large enough to swallow a human in one bite. She swam down to Seremak, helping him get oriented so as to push off the bottom. Seremak crested the surface long enough to draw in a fresh lungful of air.

<P>The Dinicythis keyed off of Katriana's sudden movement, and darted in to bite her severely. She managed to cast <I>Summon Nature's Ally</I> to call a medium sized water elemental, hoping to keep the fish at bay.

<P>Edwin decided he would be better off dropping into the water than continuing to cling to the wall. Had he seen the giant fish he might have thought differently. As he was able to brace himself he took minimal damage on impact but immediately sunk owing to the weight of his robes and equipment.

<P>Grapthar and Rai reached the shallows surrounding the island and pulled themselves ashore.

<P>Still crouching on the staircase to the fire level, Kaerick cast a second <I>Cure Light Wounds</I> on Chaden to heal the remainder of the boulder damage.

<DIV ID="quote" ALIGN=RIGHT>&quot;It would suck if the fish comes after me.&quot; --Katriana<BR>&quot;The fish comes after you.&quot; --The GM</DIV>




<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 9</H3>
Having soaked up a great deal of damage from the Fire Bats and the Dinicythis, Katriana <I>wildshaped</I> into an octopus to release an ink cloud and swim to a hiding spot in the coral reef.

<P>Seremak managed to shout &quot;Grapthar, bring a rope!&quot; before sinking back to the bottom where, due to another failed Swim check, he made no progress toward the island. Grapthar grabbed a rope and waded back into the water. The Dinicythis decided to check whether Seremak was edible, biting him severely.

<P>Edwin managed to get his bearings and try to swim toward the island, but was outmaneuvered by the prehistoric fish. Edwin was severely bitten.

<P>On the Fire level Chaden and Kaerick popped up to shoot at the giant. Chaden hit once. The giant's flung boulder missed by several feet.

<CENTER><IMG ID="scoreboard" SRC="round9.gif" WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=103 ALT="Scoreboard" TITLE="Hit Points Inflicted"><BR><DIV ID="caption">Hit Points Inflicted</DIV></CENTER>



<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 10</H3>
Seremak tried to get his legs underneath him to push off toward the island. Instead due to another failed Swim check he pushed himself into the path of the Dinicythis, and was bitten again.

<P>Katriana cast <I>Hide from Animals,</I> just about the perfect spell for the occasion. After letting it take effect on herself she swam out to simultaneously touch Seremak, Grapthar, and Edwin. Unbeknownst to the adventurers the Dinicythis succumbed to the illusion on everyone except Seremak.

<P>Edwin got tangled up in his robes and equipment and simply floated in place. His uncanny gnomish constitution allowed him to hold his breath for a very long period of time, but would eventually fail him.

<P>Katriana's summoned Water Elemental finally landed a hit on the Dinicythis, but did not phase it in the slightest. The creature had tasted blood, nothing else mattered.

<P>Chaden hit the Fire Giant twice and Kaerick hit once. The giant flung another boulder, hitting Chaden in the leg. She shook off the pain and continued firing.

<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 11</H3>
In essentially the only successful action of the round, Katriana cast <I>Water Breathing</I> and reached out tentacles to touch Seremak, Grapthar, and Edwin. The spell also affected her, in case she abandoned the octopus form for something else.

<P>Seremak failed his swim check again <I>[Editor's note: he rolled a 1]</I> and made no progress. The Dinicythis bit him again.

<P>Edwin failed his swim check and made no progress. Grapthar also failed his.

<P>The Water Elemental missed.

<P>Chaden hit the Fire Giant one more time with her bow, but was hit by a second boulder. She retreated back down the staircase. Kaerick missed.

<CENTER><IMG ID="scoreboard" SRC="round11.gif" WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=103 ALT="Scoreboard" TITLE="Hit Points Inflicted"><BR><DIV ID="caption">Hit Points Inflicted</DIV></CENTER>




<HR WIDTH=60%"><H3>Round 12</H3>
Katriana wrapped a tentacle around Edwin, who was closest to her. Edwin, having no idea the octopus was actually Katriana in <I>wildshape,</I> slashed at the tentacle with his dagger. Fortunately Edwin is completely inept at melee combat, and missed.

<P>Seremak failed another swim check, and so was only able to move another 5 feet. Unfortunately the fish was faster: its attack of opportunity knocked Seremak unconscious at -6 hp, while its second attack killed him outright at -28 hp.

<P>Katriana and Grapthar managed to pull Seremak onto the beach. Rai ran over to sniff at his master's body, and emitted a piercing wail.

<P>Kaerick grazed the Fire Giant with an arrow, but was then badly hurt by a boulder. She joined Chaden halfway down the staircase.

<HR WIDTH=60%"><A NAME="unguent"><H3>Aftermath</H3></A>
Edwin retrieved a jar of Unguent of Timelessness from his Handy Haversack, which magically retrieves whatever item the owner needs. Invoking <I>Prestidigitation</I> to help (another gnomish innate ability), he spread the goo over Seremak's corpse. The adventurers hoped this would slow the passage of time sufficiently to allow Katriana to cast <I>Last Breath</I> the next morning after resting to regain her spells. Otherwise, Seremak could only be revived when the party returned to <A HREF="../r1/index.html">Urnst</A>.

<P>After four more rounds of combat, the Water Elemental killed the Dinicythis and returned to its plane of origin.

<P>During this time Chaden and Kaerick healed themselves again, but when they ventured up from the staircase the Fire Giant was nowhere to be seen. Chaden cast <I>Hail of Stone</I> to target the area covered by Edwin's <I>Fog Cloud,</I> but had no way to know whether she hit anything. <I>[Editor's note: it was realized afterwards that the Fire Giant had likely taken cover in the sea of flame. If one is immune to fire, it makes sense to take advantage of it.]</I>

<BR><I>(Repeating from a previous <A HREF="../r4/index.html#postscript">chronicle</A>, perhaps of more relevance now):</I>
<BR>There are two sentences in Kaerick's recollections of the history of the <A HREF="../r2/index.html#ghostgem">Ghost Gem</A> which may be important at this point:
<BLOCKQUOTE ID="galapdreidel">Stories say that the light of the gem ripped the life from the bodies of men and disintegrated their flesh to dust.<P>They also say that he who controlled the gem could call forth numerous denizens to do his bidding.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Ripping the life from the bodies of men&quot; sounds like a Will save to this humble Chronicler; appropriate buffs would be in order.
<P>Crumbling to dust sounds like a <I>Disintigrate</I> effect; a <I>Wall of Force</I> to take cover behind could be useful.
<P>Summoned denizens implies there will be a portable horde to fight:  <I>Fireball</I> early,&nbsp; <I>Fireball</I> often. <I>Protection From Evil</I> or <I>Magic Circle Against Evil</I> could prevent summoned evil creatures from attacking us, though we don't know that the Gem will always summon evil creatures.
