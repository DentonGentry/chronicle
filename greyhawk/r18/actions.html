	<LI>It took 36 hours of research at the Wizard's Tower to determine
		how to join the sections of the staff, and Edwin spent another 12
		hours researching the Staff of Law, the Wind Dukes, the Queen of
		Chaos, and specifically any weaknesses Miska or the wolf-spiders
		have.
	<LI>During the time spent researching Edwin spent 8 hours a day in
		the library, 8 hours enchanting items, 2 hours sleeping (thanks
		to the <I>Ring of Sustenance</I>) and 6 hours on misc &quot;stuff&quot;
	<LI>Edwin took advantage of the Alchemy lab to distill the harvested
		<A HREF="../r17/index.html#ambush">wolf-spider</A> poison sacs
		into more antitoxin (five normal and one large). The six venom
		sacs from <A HREF="../r11/index.html">Phase Spiders</A>, four
		<A HREF="../r15/index.html#shriekers">Violet Fungi</A> tentacles,
		and two <A HREF="../r15/index.html#chuul">Chuul</A> tentacles were
		distilled into contact poison.
		Edwin also attempted to incorporate wolf-spider web material into
		a ultra-tanglefoot bag.
	<LI>Edwin cast <I>Flesh to Stone</I> on the Aboleth Egg, preserving it
		for later study.
	<LI>Kaerick located a <A HREF="../r9/index.html#ambush">depository</A>
		to withdraw her share of the loot from the
		<A HREF="../r8/index.html">Ghost Tower of Inverness</A>
	<LI>Edwin purchased a number of spell components and foci:
		<UL>
			<LI>miniature Ivory Portal, 15gp, focus for
				<I>Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion</I>
			<LI>ivory strips, 200gp, focus for <I>Legend Lore</I>
			<LI>gold listening cone, 50gp, focus for <I>Sonic Rumble</I>
			<LI>adamantine strip, 100gp, focus for <I>Ironguard</I>
			<LI>a pearl, 100gp, focus for <I>Defenstrating Sphere</I>
			<LI>a tiny lens of ruby in a gold loop, 1500gp, focus for
				<I>Analyze Dweomer, Gemjump,</I> and <I>Ruby Ray of Reversal</I>
			<LI>a tiny statue of Edwin carved from ivory and decorated
				with 1500gp of gems, focus for <I>Contingency</I>. The gems
				will be diamonds, so we can scavenge them for a resurrection
				if necessary.

			<LI>an ointment of saffron and rare herbs, 250gp, material
				component for one casting of <I>True Seeing</I>
			<LI>a silver bar, 50gp, for one casting of <I>Seal Portal</I>
			<LI>diamond dust, 1000gp worth. It takes 50gp for one casting
				of <I>Hardening, Nondetection, Stoneskin, Earthlock,</I> or
				<I>Diamondsteel.</I> Also we can use it for a resurrection
				spell.
			<LI>Jade dust, 250gp worth. It takes 250gp worth to cast
				<I>False Vision,</I> and 100gp for <I>Permanent Image</I>
			<LI>powdered silver, 200gp worth. It takes 25gp to cast <I>Wall
				of Chaos/Law/Good/Evil.</I>
			<LI>powdered gold, 50gp worth. It takes 50gp to cast <I>Wall of 
				Iron.</I>

			<LI>3400gp worth of material to enchant items for himself (to
				take his Headband of Intellect up to +3, make a Crystal o
				Stamina and a Tome of Worldly Memory).
		</UL>
	<LI>Edwin cast <I>Hardening</I> on essentially all of the party's gear,
		increasing its hardness by 6 (which makes it more difficult to break
		or sunder).
	<LI>Chaden went in search of a Greatsword +2.
	<LI>Purchase a few tiny lanterns with good shutters, and velvet lined.
		These will be used to hold <I>Celestial Brilliance</I> spells, for use
		against demons.
