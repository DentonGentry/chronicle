<H2>Chapter 18: Please Do Not Feed the Dragon</H2>

&nbsp;<BR><IMG SRC="../fonts/A.gif" ALT="A" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=72 WIDTH=76 ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=3 VSPACE=1>s had become their habit, the adventurers harvested the poison sacks of the wolf-spiders to synthesize more anti-toxin. The web spinners were also harvested, as Edwin had vague notions of making extra-strength tanglefoot bags.
					<SPAN ID="quote1">&quot;If it turns me lawful good
					I'm going to kill you.  Oh wait, I'll be lawful
					good.&quot; -- Edwin</SPAN>
<BR>&nbsp; Since recovering the <A HREF="../r16/index.html#secondsegment">second segment</A> of the <A HREF="../r9/index.html#staffhistory">Staff of Law,</A> the party had steadfastly avoided attempting to combine the two segments for fear of its behavior compulsions becoming stronger. The <A HREF="../r9/index.html#wandend">first segment</A> of the staff ended in a precise crystalline pattern, which appeared to perfectly match the narrow end of the second segment. As recovery of the second segment had triggered yet <A HREF="../r9/index.html#ambush">another</A> <A HREF="../r10/index.html#ambush">demonic</A> <A HREF="../r17/index.html#ambush">ambush,</A> each further segment would likely trigger more attacks. Reassembling the staff might unlock additional powers, and help fend off the demons. Edwin (who had the best Will save, and also cast <I>Owl's Wisdom</I>) carefully brought both segments of the staff together... and the second segment disappeared!

<P>&nbsp; After recovering from the shock, the party determined that the staff had become tainted with Chaos when it was sundered as it was used to destroy <A HREF="../r9/index.html#staffhistory">Miska the Wolf-Spider</A>. The segments would need to be cleansed of Chaos before they could be reassembled, though researching a method for cleansing the staff would require an extensive wizard's library. The tug of the first segment now pointed directly south, roughly in the direction of Dyvers, a free city and democratic meritocracy.

<P><A NAME="vastestbog"><U>The Narrator</U></A>
<BR>&nbsp; <A NAME="gazebo">&nbsp;</A> The second segment of the staff was already in the possession of another creature. Edwin believed that only intelligent artifacts would seek a protector, implying that the staff contained a certain sentience. The party healed damage sustained in the battle with demons, then Edwin cast <I>Shadow Walk</I> to travel 280 miles due south in a few hours by skirting the edge of the Plane of Shadow. The group emerged in a swamp, but one which did not exist on the map. Chaden recognized it as the Vastest Bog, a huge swamp near Greyhawk connecting to the Mist Marsh. The rest of the party had never heard of the place... it seemed to be
<A HREF="../r8/index.html#throneroom">another</A>
<A HREF="../r9/index.html#chaosincursion">incursion</A> of
<A HREF="../r17/index.html#chaosincursion">chaos</A>. The group walked for half an hour following the tug of the first segment, coming at last to a sandy hillock surrounded by water. Katriana wildshaped into an Eagle to scout the terrain, finding nothing of note. Chaden threw a <A HREF="gazebo.html">knife</A> into it, to verify it wasn't some enormous creature. Edwin cast <I>Prying Eyes,</I> with the following instructions:
<BR><DIV ID="pryingeyes">&quot;Spread out in pairs to search the island for entrances. If found, one return now and the other search for 10 minutes.&quot;</DIV>

<P>&nbsp; The instructions contained a serious flaw: if no entrances were found, the <I>Prying Eyes</I> would keep searching until the spell expired fourteen hours later. After two hours of waiting the party retired to a <I>Leomund's Secure Shelter.</I> Expecting attack at any time Edwin enchanted a <I>Restful Crystal</I> to allow Grapthar to sleep in his plate armor, but the night passed uneventfully. The next morning the group circled the island to triangulate the position of the second segment, noting that the pull of the wand was always toward the center of the island. Edwin created a <I>Dark Way</I> of shadowstuff to allow passage across the water to the island. That is when the dragon swept down out of the sky.

<DIV ID="ecology"><P><U>The Ecology of the Black Dragon</U>
<BR>Black dragons (a.k.a. &quot;Skull Dragons&quot;) are the most vile tempered and cruel of all chromatic dragons. Physically, black dragons are most distinguished by their horns, which protrude from the sides of their heads and wrap around, projecting forward. A large frill adorns the upper part of the neck. They smell like rotting vegetation and foul water, or like the powerful acid they can breathe.

<P>Black dragons are sometimes known as skull dragons because of their skeletal faces. Adding to the skeletal impression is the gradual deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn and the cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and does not harm the dragon. On hatching, a black dragon's scales are thin, small, and glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and duller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.

<P>Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins before killing them.                 <SPAN ID="ecologyattrib">--d20 SRD</SPAN>
</DIV>

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The dragon was gargantuan. From its size and the coloring of its scales, it was clearly an ancient wyrm. It projected a palpable aura of fear: everyone was shaken by it except Edwin, who rolled particularly well for the Will save. The Dragon swooped in, grabbed Edwin in its claws, and flew away in the blink of an eye. There was no time to react; Chaden fired several arrows as the dragon soared away, but they simply bounced from its scales.

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The dragon dropped Edwin near the highest point of the island, in thick brambles. Chaden and Katriana saw the dragon circle around, disappearing into the thick vegetation on one side of the island. The party began casting defensive magic and trudging up the island toward Edwin, while Katriana flew up to the top to look for him.
<IMG SRC="telegram.jpg" ALT="Telegram" BORDER=1 HEIGHT=175 WIDTH=250 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=7 VSPACE=7>
<BR>&nbsp; The tug from the first segment of the staff now pointed straight down. Edwin cast <I>Message</I> to inform the rest of the party of what he was about to do, then cast <I>Xorn Movement</I> to travel through the earth, emerging at the top of a large cavern in the middle of the island. An acrid spell permeated the place, and the rock was pitted and worn. Directly below was a large, flat black stone, with the second segment of the staff upon it. The rest of the cavern was filled with treasure: coins, gems, weapons and suits of armor, everything one would expect in an ancient dragon hoard. All of the coins and treasures had been neatly stacked, and much recently disturbed dust was floating through the chamber. The second segment of the staff had apparently been inflicting its cleanliness compulsion, turning the normally Chaotic Evil dragon toward Lawful. Presumably this was the reason the dragon wished to be rid of it.
<BR><A NAME="demonattack">&nbsp;</A> The dragon spotted Edwin immediately. &quot;Take that accursed thing and go!&quot; Suddenly Edwin heard a skittering from the cave entrance. Three wolf-spiders scurried into the cave, accompanied by one of the larger spiders. The dragon hissed in anger and breathed a torrent of potent acid, destroying the three lesser demons. The larger demon spoke out loud: &quot;Servant of chaos, cease! You threaten the will of one who is mistress to us all!&quot;
<P>&nbsp; Edwin could not tarry long before the <I>Xorn Movement</I> would expire, and decided to use the distraction to his advantage. Casting <I>Mage Hand</I> to retrieve the segment, he immediately headed for the top of the island. Several rounds later the dragon could be heard roaring in rage. Once reunited the party used <I>Dimension Door</I> to retrieve the horses and immediately cast <I>Shadow Walk</I> to get out of the area.

<P><U>Greyhawk</U>
					<SPAN ID="quote4">&quot;We need to come up with the most 
					obscure and complicated way possible to obtain some Lawful 
					Evil hair.&quot; -- The Players<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
					&quot;I think the nefarious barber shop is a good 
					start.&quot; -- The GMs</SPAN>
<BR><A NAME="ritual">&nbsp;</A> With the second segment recovered, the next task would be to determine how the segments could be cleansed of the taint of Miska's blood in order to be reassembled. The closest suitable library would be in the Free City of Greyhawk, so that is where the party turned. Edwin went immediately to the Wizard's Tower, presenting his letter of introduction from <A HREF="../r9/index.html#wandend">Garmoth</A>, the master of the Wizard's Tower in Leukesh. After a total of 36 hours of searching Edwin had pieced together the answer: by inscribing glyphs onto both pieces and conducting an arcane ritual, the segments could be rejoined. Painting the glyphs would require a brush containing at least one hair from a Lawful Good and a Lawful Evil creature, and the hair must be <U>freely given</U>.

<P>&nbsp; The various party members also did a little <A HREF="actions.html">shopping</A>. It is <U>Greyhawk</U>, after all.
