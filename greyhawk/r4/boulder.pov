The answer is: he didn't. * The boulder in the gaming session was just a regular * rock. The image was made to look like a boulder * trap from Dungeon Keeper, an incredibly cool game  * from 1999 which a number of the players enjoyed back * in the day. * * Scale is 1 POVunit == 1 foot. * * Created 5/16/99 by Denton Gentry for Return to * the Tomb of Horrors chapter 3. Adapted 11/27/2005 * for the Greyhawk campaign. */global_settings {	assumed_gamma 1.8	ambient_light rgb<1, 1, 1>}// Texture by Chuck Fusner, http://www.enter.net/~cfusner#local RoughStone = texture { //rough stone texture...	pigment { //nice and random on the pigment.		granite		color_map {		[ 0 rgb .5 ]		[ .25 rgb .65 ]		[ .5 rgb .5 ]		[ .75 rgb .7 ]		[ 1 rgb .5 ]		}		frequency 100	}	normal { /*love that crackle!
