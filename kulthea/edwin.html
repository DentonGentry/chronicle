<H2>Edwin, the Loremaster</H2>

Edwin is a Loremaster, one of a group of powerful mages who stand against the
Unlife. His base of operations is a shop called "curious goods". The shop is
extradimensional, being vastly larger within that it appears from without.
It is filled with books and lore, the tools used by the Ascension to resist
the Unlife. Edwin is a gnome of indeterminate age.

<P>Edwin is attended by Mathilda, his assistant. Mathilda is a cursed
shapeshifter, appearing in a variety of forms. In the image below
Mathilda is a rosemary bush.
