other unresolved.
<OL TYPE=I>
	<LI> <A HREF="c1/index.html">Knee Deep In the Dead</A>
	<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
		<LI><B>Q</B>: a <A HREF="c1/index.html#gargoyle">winged humanoid</A>
			creature hovered near the edge of the canyon, watching
			the party enter the Coalition building. Then it flew away.
			Later I believe we determined that it was _not_ an
			Amarrishi. So what was it?<BR>
			<B>A</B>: The Unlife have minions of necroplasm shaped
			like gargoyles. One was encountered in
			<A HREF="c5/index.html#gargoyle">'Til They Glow</A>.
			Why the Unlife was watching is not known.
	</UL>

	<LI> <A HREF="c2/index.html">Demons of the Burning Night</A>
	<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
		<LI><B>Q</B>: Pyreforge called Blackhawk a
			<A HREF="c2/index.html#pyreforge">"Progenitor"</A>.
			Whats up with that?<BR>
		<B>A</B>: The
			<A HREF="c4/index.html#progenitor">Progenitors</A>
			are the ancient Althans.
	</UL>

	<LI> <A HREF="c3/index.html">Oh, The Places You'll Smell</A>
	<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
		<LI><B>Q</B>: There were a series of
			<A HREF="c3/index.html#shards">breakins</A> of libraries
			and curio shops in Mopheus and Bazilar, focusing on
			books of necromancy. Why? We verified the Unlife
			was not raising those who died of the Sickness in
			Bazilar. The breakins were conducted by Shards, who later
			<A HREF="c4/index.html#shards">attacked</A> the
			Gathering of the Ascention.
		<LI><B>Q</B>: while sailing from Mopheus to Bazilar a
			<A HREF="c3/index.html#dragon">dragon</A>
			flew overhead on the first night. It might
			simply have been a spotter for the Black Ship
			which attacked two nights later, but was it
			something else?<BR>
			<B>A</B>: It was most likely the
			<A HREF="c3/index.html#blackship">dude in black
			plate</A> flying over who spotted the ship and
			attacked two nights later.
		<LI><B>Q</B>: Who was the
			<A HREF="c3/index.html#blackship">dude in black
			plate</A> toting a machinegun aboard the Black Ship,
			who dove off the railing to escape?<BR>
			<B>A</B>: He was encountered again in
			<A HREF="c4/index.html#mendaline">Smells Like Plasma,
			Tastes Like Chicken!</A>.
			He is associated with the Dragon Lords, though he is
			not a Dragon Lord himself.
		<LI><B>Q</B>: The Sickness in Bazilar intensified when the rift
			to the Unlife opened. Is there a connection?
			What is the Sickness?
		<LI><B>Q</B>: The Coalition Garrison in Bazilar got a new Commander ten
			years ago, at roughly the time the Sickness worsened. The
			Commander disappeared when Erona took over, and the Coalition
			troops reported directly to Erona. Who was the Commander, and was
			he connected to the Sickness or to the Unlife?

	<LI> <A HREF="c4/index.html">Smells Like Plasma, Tastes Like Chicken!</A>
	<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
		<LI><B>Q</B>: At the Gathering of the Ascention a monk of the
			Golden Path gave Frisbee a
			<A HREF="c4/index.html#frisbeecrystal">crystal</A>.
			What does it do?<BR>
			<B>A</B>: It is a
			<A HREF="c5/index.html#frisbeecrystal">training device</A>
			of the Golden Path, allowing a journeying monk access to
			the advanced techniques.
		<LI><B>Q</B>: We spotted an enormous
			<A HREF="c4/index.html#dragon">tail</A> settling behind
			the mansion as we approached. What was it?<BR>
			<B>A</B>: It was the dude in black plate mail arriving.
		<LI><B>Q</B>: The <A HREF="c4/index.html#mendaline">Mendaline</A>
			sorceror conducting the ritual for the Unlife was wearing
			the robe which Blackhawk had seen the human wearing in his
			psychometry. Who was the human, and why was the Mendaline
			wearing his robe?<BR>
			<B>A</B>: Most likely the human in the vision was the
			Mendaline using an illusion to look human.
		<LI><B>Q</B>: The Progenitor starship
			<A HREF="c4/index.html#crashsite">crashed</A> on a small
			moon. The mansion stood on that moon when the ship crashed.
			How did the mansion and the crash site come to be on
			the First Pale?
		<LI><B>Q</B>: A Progenitor spirit in the crypt seemed to merge
			with Blackhawk, and his aura began to radiate brightly. What's
			up with that?
		<LI><B>Q</B>: The Althans in the underground cavern seemed to have
			regressed to a technologically primitive society. What
			happened to cause this?
		<LI><B>Q</B>: What was the original purpose of the "prison", where
			the Unlife was holding their ritual? How did the Unlife get
			in?
	</UL>

	<LI> <A HREF="c5/index.html">'Til They Glow</A>
	<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
		<LI><B>Q</B>: One night during the journey across Rhakaan Urk spotted
			a <A HREF="c5/index.html#cloakedfigure">cloaked figure</A> 
			at the edge of the camp. What was it?
		<LI><B>Q</B>: Sasfiry attuned to an
			<A HREF="c5/index.html#sasfiryamulet">amulet</A> which
			showed her an extensive vision. What other effects does it
			have?<BR>
			<B>A</B>: It has made her into a member of the Angelus,
			an ancient order of warrior women who fight the Unlife.
