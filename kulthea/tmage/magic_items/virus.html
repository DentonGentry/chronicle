<H2>Arcane Computer Virus</H2>
<IMG SRC="virus.gif" ALT="Computer Chip" WIDTH=76 HEIGHT=95>

<P>&nbsp; A small microprocessor inscribed with Arcane Runes, the Virus
has been enchanted with a low level of intelligence. It can magically interface
to a computer system it is placed in close proximity to, and will follow
instructions in wreaking havoc with that computer system for up to 24 hours
before its enchantments fade.

<P>&nbsp; Creating this device is a complex process. First the device
must be enchanted. After enchantment the technomage must repeatedly
cast Interface I to train the newly formed intelligence in computer
technics. This training process proceeds very quickly due to the
extreme speed of the neural communication, but must still be granted
an entire day free from other activity for its completion. An
extremely hard (-30) Computer Technics roll must be made at the end of
this day; failure indicates that the device is not functional. Once
trained, the Virus goes dormant until activated. Once activated the
enchantments last for 1 day before fading. The microchip vaporizes
when the enchantments fade, leaving no trace of its presence.

<P>Weight: 0.1 lbs

<P>Spells used: Low Intelligence (8), Arcane Embed II (5), Interface I (2)
<BR>Time to enchant: 9 days for enchantment plus 1 day to train
