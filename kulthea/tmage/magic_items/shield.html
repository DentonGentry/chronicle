<H2>Arcane Shield Projector</H2>

<IMG SRC="shield.gif" ALT="Shielding Wand" WIDTH=351 HEIGHT=273>

<P>&nbsp; A hollow metal box with a hinged, latching back, the whole slightly
larger than a standard Coalition weapon cell. Inside the hollow two studs
protrude from the top which will align with the power contacts of an inserted
weapon cell.

<P>&nbsp; There are runes inscribed on each side of the projector. Other
than the runes and the two interior studs there are no distinguishing features
or mechanism. A Coalition tech examining the device would determine that
it served no function.

<P>&nbsp; When the Rune is pressed a Shield spell is cast, and is autonomously
guided to protect its wielder for the duration of the spell, or until the
weapon cell runs out of charges.

<P>Weight: 0.75 lbs

<P>Spells used: Arcane Embed II (5), Shield (2), Drain Charge (2)
<BR>Time to enchant: 20 days
