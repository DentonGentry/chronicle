<H2>Non-ballistic shells</H2>
&nbsp; Xenium is a magical metal found only on Kulthea which has the
property of negating gravity. The skyships of Eidolon employ broad plates
of Xenium under their hulls to enable their means of travel.
<BR>&nbsp; Ballistic motion, as from a projectile weapon, is governed
by the force of gravity. However, if the projectile is completely
coated with Xenium it becomes substantially immune to the effects of
gravity (unavoidable deformation of the Xenium due to the explosion of
the propellant make it slightly susceptible to gravity). Thus, air
friction becomes the primary force acting on the projectile, and its
range is far greater than usual.
<BR>&nbsp; These non-ballistic projectiles have five times normal range
for their weapon type. They fly straight from the point of their launch,
dropping in velocity due to friction until they settle slowly to the
ground. To represent this in game terms the penalty for long range
is doubled and extreme range is tripled. For example, if a weapon's normal
characteristics are:
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="1">
<TR> <TD>point blank</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>1'-10'</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>+10</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD>short</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>11'-55'</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>0</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD>medium</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>56'-110'</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>-25</TD> </TR>

<TR> <TD>extreme</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>301'-400'</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>-100</TD> </TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>then when firing non-ballistic shells its range characteristics will be:
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="1">
<TR> <TD>point blank</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>1'-50'</TD> <TD ALIGN=RIGHT>+10</TD> </TR>
