<H2>Enchanted Armor</H2>
&nbsp; Alchemists find enchanted armor very time-consuming to produce due
to the volume of material which must be enchanted. Technomagic enchants
the aura of an item as a whole, so the size of the item makes little difference
(only the complexity of the aura matters). Thus technomages are able to
enchant armor somewhat more quickly than an alchemist could, though of
course the technomage is enchanting an existing suit of armor while the
alchemist is creating a new suit of armor from raw materials.
<BR>&nbsp; Armor enchanted by a technomage gains several of the advantages
that alchemically produced armor has:
<UL>
	<LI>It provides a bonus to the DB. The exact bonus depends on the spells used
	to enchant.
	<LI>If the armor must make an RR it saves at the level of its wearer (non-magical
	armor saves at level 1).
	<LI>As a magic item it will protect against certain extra-planar creatures
	which are unaffected by normal weapons or armor.
	<LI>It protects against firearms as modern armor, rather than archaic. The
	modern armor class provided depends on the area covered by the armor, and
	is shown on the following table:

<P>&nbsp; However, there are several other advantages enjoyed by armor created
by an Alchemist which Technomagic armor does not gain:
<UL>
	<LI>The Alchemist will make the armor lighter and more flexible, reducing its
	maneuver penalties. Armor enchanted by a Technomage has the same maneuver
	penalties as the normal armor had.
	<LI>Armor created by an alchemist will generally fit itself to its wearer,
	so to large extent "one size fits all". Armor enchanted by a technomage
	does not do this, and must be manufactured of the proper size to fit its
	wearer.
