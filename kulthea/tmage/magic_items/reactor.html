<H2>Elemental Reactor</H2>
&nbsp; A fusion reactor consists of a magnetically sealed chamber
containing hydrogen gas which is compressed and heated until the atoms
begin to fuse into helium. It is possible to weave a Rune into the
magnetic field which will confine an Elemental from the plane of Light
inside the chamber. The presence of such concentrated living
electromagnetic energy increases the fusion reaction manyfold,
allowing more power to be drawn from the reactor without overloading
it. A reactor can supply power as the next size up while an elemental
is confined (i.e. a belt pack can supply power as a backpack, etc).
<BR>&nbsp; However, since the Rune of confinement is woven into the
magnetic field it persists only as long as the field persists.
If the reactor ever shuts down (or the field is otherwise disrupted)
the Elemental will escape. As it is unlikely an Elemental would have
willingly entered such an arrangement it will be quite upset
over the whole affair. For this reason only Weak Elementals of Light
are bound into service inside reactors, the risk of releasing an
enraged Strong Elemental is too terrible to contemplate.
