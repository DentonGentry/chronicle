<H2>Ordinance</H2>
&nbsp; Among the more common things to enchant is ammunition. Ammo is reasonably
small and simple, and can be vastly more effective when enchanted with
a single charge of a spell. Typically a Rune of the Howitzer will also
be inscribed if a charged enchantment is placed.

<H2>Undead Repulsion Shells</H2>
<IMG SRC="ordinance.gif" ALT="Ordinance" HEIGHT=166 WIDTH=188>

<P>&nbsp; These shells are enchanted with a single charge of <I>Repel Undead
V</I> (from the Cleric base list). Due to the nature of its delivery mechanism
the spell can only affect one Undead, and only if the attack hits (i.e.
causes some concussive damage, indicating the target was struck). Up to
class V undead can be affected, where class is computed from the level
of the Undead creature.

<P>&nbsp; Animated Dead (from the Necromancy spell list) are automatically
disintegrated. Other Undead are entitled to an RR; if they fail by more
than 50 they disintegrate, if they fail by less than 50 they must flee
the area or remain motionless. For each class under V the undead saves
at -5, as reflected in the chart above.

<H2>Holy Hand Grenade</H2>
<IMG SRC="grenade.gif" ALT="Hand Grenade" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=95 WIDTH=79>

<P>&nbsp; Similar to the shells above, these grenades cast a Repel Undead
IX spell when they detonate. They affect all Undead within a 20 foot radius.
Up to 9 points of undead, as determined on the table above, can be affected.
For every point less than 9 of undead within the area of effect, all undead
take a -5 to their RR. Thus if there are only two undead, each class II,
they both make their RR at -25.

<H2>Nanoprobe slugs</H2>
&nbsp; Generally built as armor-piercing rounds, these hollow bullets contain
modified nanoprobe technology adapted from necroborgs. When a creature
of the Unlife is struck by such a shell and a critical is indicated the
nanoprobes will extend and attempt to attach to the creature's nervous
system. The Unlife is entitled to an RR at -30, if the RR is failed additional
effects will be felt depending on the magnitude of the failure as shown
on the table below. The nanoprobe's effect continues until they run out
of power; the amount of time is also listed in the table.

<H2>HEAP arrow</H2>
&nbsp; An otherwise normal arrow fitted with a High Explosive Armor Piercing
warhead. A bow firing such an arrow uses the range modifiers from the longbow
table but inflicts damage on the ME10 + HEAP table.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Weight: 20% greater than normal arrow

<P>Spells used: non-magical (typically Rune of the Howitzer or Weapon I
is inscribed after construction)
<BR>Time to construct: varies
<P>

<HR>

<H2>Chopping Arrow</H2>
&nbsp; A normal arrow with a broad, curved blade attached to its tip. The
blade is intended to cut ropes or cords from a distance, not for use in
combat. When used for cutting ropes or similar tricky shots it adds +15
to the maneuver/attack roll. If used against a regular target it suffers
an OB modifier of -10 and inflicts criticals of one less severity than
normal.
<BR>&nbsp; Note: this type of arrow was developed in feudal Japan, where
cutting down the enemy banner was likely to demoralize his troops and thus
gain advantage in time of war.

<P>Weight: 20% greater than normal arrow

<P>Spells used: typically Rune of the Howitzer is inscribed on such arrows
<BR>Time to construct: varies

<HR>

<H2>"I _Was_ Aiming for the Wall!"</H2>
&nbsp; Enchanted with a single charge of <I>Stun Cloud I</I>, these rounds
are intended to be fired into a concentration of the enemy while deliberately
missing any single target. When they strike the spell is cast, and one
round later all within a 5 foot radius begin to take electricity criticals
from the spell.

<P>Weight: normal for the projectile
