<H2>Encrypting Radio</H2>
&nbsp; There is a type of rare ruby known to crystalist casters of Essence
which, when charged with power, twinkles from within with a dim light.
These gems are sometimes used as decoration for the clothing of the crystalist
caster or amongst the nobility.
<BR>&nbsp; Technomages know the ruby as something else entirely. The luminescent
flashes of the charged gemstone are completely random. They do not correlate
to any environmental factors, only to the power held in their crystal.
If such a ruby is charged with power and then carefully split, the shards
of the original crystal continue their flashes in unison. Thus they are
a source of synchronized chaos, totally correlated between themselves and
totally unpredictable otherwise. If the flashing of the crystals is sampled
and used as an encryption key an essentially unbreakable code results.

<P>&nbsp; A matched set of radios can be built, each with an internal chamber
to hold a shard of a charged ruby crystal. The chamber is lined with photodiodes
to detect and measure the flashes of the gem which drive the encryption
of the communications channel. The only known way to break this encryption
code is the use of divination magic to predict the flashing of the crystal.
The crystal shard used in the radios is quite small, charged only weakly
with essence, and completely sealed inside the mechanism, so focusing divination
magic on it would be very difficult.

<P>&nbsp; The only thing which can disturb the synchronized chaos of the
shards is if an individual shard is charged by a source of power which
the other shards do not experience. Detuning a shard renders it useless
for encrypted communications with its brethren. This can be done deliberately
by a crystalist caster of essence, who must touch the shard to do so. It
can also happen by stray radiation from intense sources of magic, as follows:
<UL>
	<LI>Whenever a person carrying a synchronized shard is hit by an elemental
	attack there is a 1/2% chance per level of the spell that the crystal will
	be detuned.
	<LI>Each day spent in a lesser earth node has a 5% chance of detuning the
	crystal shard.
	<LI>Each day spent in a greater earth node has a 15% chance of detuning the
	crystal shard.
</UL>
Weight: the shard weight is negligible.
