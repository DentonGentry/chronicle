<H2>Bag of Sound Sleeping</H2>
<IMG SRC="sleepbag.gif" ALT="Sleeping Bag" WIDTH=171 HEIGHT=140>

<P>&nbsp; A variable-insulation polymer sleeping bag of standard Coalition
military issue. A control panel at the head of the bag has a readout of
the current time, temperature, humidity and other atmospheric conditions.
The control panel can adjust the insulation level provided by the polymer
bag to suit the ambient conditions, and can also be set to awaken its occupant
at a specific time via audible alarm.

<P>&nbsp; The control panel has been enchanted to cast a <I>Sleep</I>
spell, keyed to affect the occupant of the bag. The effect is to allow
the occupant to sleep normally despite the discomfort of wearing metal
armor, or other conditions which would prevent normal sleep. Each
spell cast drains a charge from the attached utility cell.

<P>Weight: 3 lbs

<P>Spells used: Arcane Embed II (5), Sleep V (1), Drain Charge (2)
<BR>Time to enchant: 18 days
