<H2>Grasping Scabbard</H2>
<IMG SRC="scabbard.gif" ALT="Scabbard" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=379 WIDTH=193>

<P>&nbsp; A hard leather scabbard of normal appearance, the grasping scabbard
contains a pneumatic mechanism with tough inflatable bags which serve to
hold the weapon in place. The enchantment in the scabbard senses when the
wielder desires to draw the weapon forth and quickly deflates the grippers
to allow the weapon to leave the scabbard freely. Because there is no resistance
to drawing the weapon the wielder gains +10 to Quickdraw or Adrenal Quickdraw
maneuvers for weapons held in the scabbard. At other times the scabbard
holds the weapon so firmly that it subtracts 25 from rolls to determine
if the weapon is lost or falls out.
<BR>&nbsp; The wielder must attune to the scabbard for proper functioning.
If a non-attuned wielder attempts to draw the weapon forth the gripping
bags remain firmly attached, resulting in -25 to Quickdraw or Adrenal Quickdraw
maneuvers. Regardless, the scabbard can sense when the weapon has been
pulled free, and will deflate the bags to avoid damage when the weapon
is reinserted.
<BR>&nbsp; There is a utility cell concealed in the tip of the scabbard
below the blade. In normal usage this cell will last for one year between
charges. If the cell is completely drained the bags deflate.

<P>Weight: normal for weapon type, typically 1.5 lbs

<P>Spells used: Empathy (4)
<BR>Time to enchant: 16 days
