<P>1. <B>Energy Perception -</B> Caster is able to trace and perceive energy
potentials and flows (such as in power supplies and circuits). Adds +10
to all repair rolls on such devices.

<P>2. <B>Drain Energy I -</B> Allows caster to drain the power from one
personal equipment power supply at the rate equal to two times his level
charges per round.

<P>3. <B>Waveguide -</B> Caster touches a point on a metallic object. That
point can then be used to target any one metallic missile attack. The range
of the missile attack is increased twofold (no affect on point blank) and
the attack is made at +20.

<P>4. <B>Charge Power Supply I -</B> Caster can charge any non-reactor-type
power supply at the rate equal to his level charges per round.

<P>5. <B>Power Surge -</B> Caster is able to cause a damaging power surge
in a device or system (must already be activated or charged) causing it
to make a roll on the Routine malfunction table.

<P>6. <B>Energy Dispersal I -</B> Caster can absorb part of the effects
of one energy attack. Attacker must subtract 10% per level of the caster
from that attack.

<P>7. <B>Drain Energy II -</B> As Drain Energy I except the range changes
to 10' per level.

<P>8. <B>Charge Power Supply III -</B> Same as Charge Power Supply I except
range changes to 10' per level.

<P>9. <B>Cloaking -</B> Allows caster to 'warp' scanner and sensor beams
so that he has a chance of not being so detected. Bonus is a base of 10%
plus 5% per level.

<P>10. <B>Energy Dispersal III -</B> As Energy Dispersal I but caster can
divide the affect between up to three attacks.

<P>11. <B>Charge Power Supply V -</B> As Charge Power Supply I but charge
rate is 2 times level per round.

<P>12. <B>Arcane Battery I -</B> Caster can take the place of one power
cell. At 15th level caster can replace one power cartridge. At 20th level
caster can replace one power pack.

<P>13. <B>Energy Dispersal V -</B> As Energy Dispersal I but up to five
attacks can be affected.

<P>14. <B>Energy Retaliation -</B> Caster can reverse any one energy attack
made against him.

<P>15. <B>Arcane Battery III -</B> As Arcane Battery I except caster can
affect up to three items simultaneously and the range
<BR>increases to 10' per level.

<P>20. <B>Energy Dispersal True -</B> As Energy Dispersal I except all
energy attacks against the caster for the current round
<BR>are affected.

<P>25. <B>Power Enhancing -</B> Caster is able to increase the power output
of any system by one increment. The caster must be touching some element
of the system being enhanced for the duration of the spell. (Examples:
A starship with a Sublight Acceleration Rating (SAR) of 6 would have it
increased to 7 if the caster was in the engine room with his hands on the
sublight engines.)

<P>30. <B>Power Routing -</B> Caster is able to act as a power conduit
and transformer. He can tap into a reactor and charge a power supply within
range (see Charge Power Supply for ranges). He can also act as a power
conduit in large scale power systems such as starships or ATV's. This can
be useful if those machines receive a critical indicating "severed power
conduit...".

<P>50. <B>Power Enhancing True -</B> Caster can cast any spell on this
list once per round as long as he concentrates.
