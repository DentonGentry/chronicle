<P>1. <B>Aura Enchantment -</B> Places a rune upon the aura
of an item. This rune has no particular effect save the make the aura slightly
magical. This would have minor effects such as allow a weapon to strike
creatures hit only by magical weapons, but is more often used to pass off
an item as magical to command a higher price.

<P>2. <B>Shield* -</B> Creates an invisible force shield in front of the
caster. This functions as a normal shield (subtracting 25 from appropriate
attacks, etc.) except it does not occupy a hand. This spell cannot be combined
with a "real" shield. [ from TC p67]

<P>3. <B>Weapon Enchantment -</B> Places a minor enchantment in a weapon.
This spell grants the weapon a bonus equal to +1 for every three levels
of the caster (at the time of the casting, the bonus does not increase
as the caster gains levels). [similar to TC p71]

<P>4. <B>Armor Enchantment -</B> Places a minor enchantment in armor. This
spell grants the armor a bonus equal to +1 for every three levels of the
caster (at the time of the casting, the bonus does not increase as the
caster gains levels).

<P>5. <B>Charge Wand -</B> Allows caster to recharge a wand from any realm.
[similar to TC p65]

<P>6. <B>Weapon I -</B> Allows the caster to enchant a weapon with a +5
bonus or a +10 bonus versus a general group (such as Elves, greater Drakes,
etc.). The bonus associated with this spell is not cumulative with other
spells on this list (e.g., casting both a Weapon I and a Weapon II will
not yield the same bonus as a Weapon III spell). [similar to TC p71]

<P>7. <B>Armor I -</B> Allows the caster to enchant armor and shields instilling
in them a +5 magical bonus or a +10 bonus versus a general group such as
Elves, greater Drakes, etc. The bonus associated with this spell is not
cumulative with other spell bonuses on this list. [similar to TC p67]

<P>8. <B>General I -</B> Allows the caster to enchant general type magic
items with a Class I bonus. The bonus associated with this spell is not
cumulative with other spell bonuses on this list. [similar to TC p68]

<P>9. <B>Charge Rod -</B> Allows caster to recharge a rod from any realm.
[similar to TC p65]

<P>10. <B>Rune of False Power -</B> Imbues an item's aura with magical
power; however this power only flows in a circuit within the aura. Spells
which identify the power level of a magical item must make an RR or will
determine the device is twice as powerful as it really is. This is often
used to increase the asking price of an item.

<P>12. <B>Weapon II -</B> As <I>Weapon I</I>, except weapons with a +10
bonus or a +15 bonus versus a general group may be enchanted.

<P>13. <B>Armor II -</B> As <I>Armor I</I>, except armor with a +10 bonus
or a +15 bonus versus a general group may be enchanted.

<P>14. <B>General II -</B> As <I>General I</I>, except general type magic
items may be enchanted with a class II bonus.

<P>15. <B>Charge Staff -</B> Allows caster to recharge a staff from any
realm. [similar to TC p65]

<P>18. <B>Weapon III -</B> As <I>Weapon I</I>, except weapons with a +15
bonus or a +20 bonus versus a general group may be enchanted.

<P>19. <B>Armor III -</B> As <I>Armor I</I>, except armor with a +15 bonus
or a +20 bonus versus a general group may be enchanted.

<P>20. <B>General III -</B> As <I>General I</I>, except general type magic
items may be enchanted with a class III bonus.

<P>35. <B>Weapon IV -</B> As <I>Weapon I</I>, except weapons with a +20
bonus or a +25 bonus versus a general group may be enchanted.

<P>40. <B>Armor IV -</B> As <I>Armor I</I>, except armor with a +20 bonus
or a +25 bonus versus a general group may be enchanted.

<P>45. <B>General IV -</B> As <I>General I</I>, except general type magic
items may be enchanted with a class IV bonus.
