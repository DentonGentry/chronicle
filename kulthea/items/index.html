with "may the cities of thy enemies fall before thee". Anyone with bardic
skills may blow the horn, loosing a sonic blast which causes 100 points
of damage to everything within 200 yards (these are structural hits). Intelligent
creatures may make an RR at -20 to resist the 100 hits, and another RR
vs a 50th level <I>Major Ultrasonics</I> spell to avoid hearing damage.
All within 15 feet of the horn are safe and hear only a low moaning sound
and are not harmed (unless underground). The Horn of Siege may be sounded
only once every Turn of Varin. If blown twice in the same ten days it explodes,
doing d100 to everyone within 50 feet. If blown underground a total collapse
results in damage equivalent to the 50th level spell <I>Quakes</I>, and
all creatures in the vicinity must make an RR at -70 or be killed instantly
in the collapse.
