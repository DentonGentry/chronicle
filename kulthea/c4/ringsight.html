<U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Chantille looked at quite a few of the items in the party's
possession while the ring was active. It would be tedious to list them all
in the main body of the Chronicle. However, since one never knows what
information might be relevant in the future everything is described
here.

<UL>
<LI>The 14" metal rod had a slight glow at one end.
<LI> The silvery strands from the necroborgs had a purplish energy
coursing through them.
<LI>The Horn of Siege appeared as a gigantic, beautiful horn with a
complex series of baffles inside.
<LI>The Arcane Power cell looked like a glob of energy which was slowly
sucking additional energy from the air.
<LI>Prophet's armor looked like a rectangular box of translucent shields
(presumably the runes which the fairies painted on it).
<LI>The 12" tablet found in the field of rubble had a strange electricity
crackling over it.
<LI>The crystal decanter and plate found in the secret room off the
crypt both had silver cords leading off into the ether; Chantille was
unable to determine where they led.
