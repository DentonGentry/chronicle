ur heroes sped away from the molten lava flow that had once been
Terek'Knev in the captured Coalition gravitic speeder courtesy of Black Cross.
Unfortunately the speeder had seen better days. The first breakdown occurred
while flying over the Sea of Fire, when the navigational computer bought the
farm. Blackhawk took the controls and flew by dead reckoning. The second
failure struck just as our heroes sped out of the Sea of Fire, when the
power output of the propulsion unit began dropping. Black Cross went aft
to try to repair the system.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>&nbsp;

<P><U>Shizlink's hidden computer file</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Me not this like. Me not this like one bit. Me escape Coalition
mining shaft, run long time, hide in engine compartment. Me only want stay
two hours, but speeder moving started before me leave could! Me fall asleep,
now speeder again move. Me not this like one bit.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Chantille</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Ze female Althan ran to ze back of ze strange vehicle. She
began rummaging around in various hidden compartments, though I know
not what she sought. She pulled out one of ze floor plates, and we
heard a high pitched scream emanate from ze hole! Ze Althan seemed
perplexed, and a moment later reached down into ze chamber to pull out
a Goblin!
<BR>&nbsp; He was like no Goblin I had ever seen in my travels. He had
a full head of hair, which was colored red. His eyes were white and
had a distinct iris, very unlike ze coal black eyes of his fellows. He
was very frightened, and scurried away into a corner. Black Cross told
him to calm down but she had to fix ze speeder.
<BR>&nbsp; Ze Goblin seemed almost in a panic. Every movement drove
him further into ze corner he had backed into. I decided something
must be done to calm him, so I cast a <I>Charm</I> spell upon his
person. He immediately smiled and looked up at me with a gleam in his
eye. [<I>Editor's note: Shizlink rolled 01 to resist the Charm spell,
so the players decided it would leave a permanent impression</I>]
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; After Shizlink's hurried introduction, he repaired the
speeder's propulsion system and things got underway again. The party
proceeded to Mopheus, where they parked the speeder under the dock and
were promptly met by a Coalition message globe which had been seeking
Blackhawk. The party had an uncomfortable moment when Chantille flew
up to the dock, startling a crowd of onlookers who had never before
seen such a thing. Obviously the fairy population had declined a bit
in the five hundred years she was imprisoned in Terek'Knev.
The crowd had gathered on the dock to watch the golden glow over the
horizon from the direction of Aranmor (which was fainter each night as
the half life of the isotopes expired).
<BR>&nbsp; The Coalition message globe was from Edwin and requested the
party to come to his shop, which was now located on the center square in
Mopheus.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Sigmund's Journal</U>
<BR>&nbsp; We found the lit'le bastard's shop quickly this time, and
bellowed at 'im to open the damned door. He waited for us in back,
with a mighty peculiar expression. He started tellin' us that the
Unlife be entering our Plane through the rip in the fabric of the
Essence, and that we had to choose sides. It dinnae seem like much of
a choice, who would stand with something which destroys all life?
Edwin said that some factions saw the Unlife as a way to drive the
Coalition from Kulthea.
<BR>&nbsp; Edwin opened a door in the back of his shop, and led the way
into a conjuring room. There were an ancient rune inscribed in the floor,
and I'll be damned if it weren't Arcane in nature. Edwin motioned all of
us to step onto the Rune and join hands, and began to cast his spell. He
showed us the tear in the Essence, the same thing what the Stone had shown me
but much clearer. When the vision ended everyone had a brand on their left
forearm, signifying their choice to stand against the Unlife.
<BR>&nbsp; We had one nights rest before setting out on our next mission.
Edwin escorted us into the largest chamber of his shop, which for tonight
at least were filled with a huge banquet table with hugely endowed women
to serve it. I knew the whole thing was an illusion, but the lasses were
well met so what difference does it make?
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Blackhawk's log, stardate 2469.3</U>
<BR>&nbsp; I will perhaps never understand how a planet of primitive
screwheads manages at times to produce such incredible technology. The
holographic display Edwin produced, with fully detailed Althan females
and authentic Althan food, was well beyond anything I believed
Kultheans capable of. Undoubtedly there was a Coalition Holometric
Projector hidden away somewhere.
<BR>&nbsp; Black Cross and I needed ammo. Black Cross knew a supplier
in the city, so everyone who needed ammo (the two of us, Urk and
Shizlink) headed into Mopheus. We found the place and went in. He had
some good items, and a lot of pure crap, but we managed to secure what
we needed. He had ammo for all of our weapons, including some 10 mm
rounds made of unknown material [<I>Editor's note: the party later
identified it as depleted uranium</I>]. He had two regener-guns from a
field hospital kit which were of an old design but still quite
workable.
<BR>&nbsp; He also had an armored exoskeleton which had obviously been
lifted from a Coalition shock troop unit. The price was pretty steep,
but with the hoard of gems we had pulled from Terek'Knev it really
didn't matter. The chain mail shirt I'd been wearing since the dragon
slagged my armor on the Navigator's ship was really chafing.
<BR>&nbsp; When we left the shop Urk suddenly told us to get ready,
he'd heard something on the rooftops above. Sure enough, shots rang
out. I took a hit in the leg, and Urk got one in the arm. Black Cross
and Shizlink returned fire, taking out the gunmen. They were Coalition
snipers, and must have been an assassination unit because their
uniforms had no insignia. We took their rifles, laser scopes,
starlight goggles, and ABS suits, and headed back to Edwin's shop.
<BR>&nbsp;

<A NAME="ninghal"></A>
<P><U>Edwin's notes</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The fight against the Unlife begins. The promising group of
newcomers returned from Aranmor one familiar face less, three new
faces added, and wiser for their journey. After introducing them
formally to the fight and embedding the mark upon their limbs I
informed them of the situation in Zor. Zor is the largest known
Earthnode on Kulthea. The Sword Sisters of Zor have lived there for
centuries, training equally in the use of Arms and ritual Arcane
magic. The ruler of their clan recently died in mysterious
circumstances. The heir apparent is Ninghal Agorawa, who lives in
Mopheus and is the companion of Kothar Londgard who runs the Singing
Frog Sanctuary. I dispatched the party to find Ninghal and inform her
of the situation, and to take whatever steps necessary to ensure her
safety.
<BR>&nbsp; It is vital that the Unlife not gain control of the
Earthnode at Zor.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Black Cross had already left Edwin's shop when the party awoke.
Edwin said she had her own mission to perform.
<BR>&nbsp; The party found the Singing Frog Sanctuary near the docks, but
arrived early in the morning to find it closed. Going across the street
to a baker shop (attempting to fulfill Sasfiry's need for coffee) they
learned that a number of libraries and curio shops had been broken into
in recent weeks. They went to the largest library in Mopheus, but discovered
it had not been hit.
<BR>&nbsp; The party returned to the Singing Frog Sanctuary and found it
open.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Sasfiry, recounting her tale much later</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Gawd, what sin or heinous act must these peoples ancestors
have done to like have the gods eradicate &quot;coffee&quot; from
their vocabulary and their very lives. These poor lost souls. Not a
drop of coffee to lift their spirits and open their eyes to the day
and the beauty of their like very existence. Because, like, after all
life is short and one should be awake through more it, ya know. Not
even someone as read and old as this like Master Edwin Scholar Dudemar
knew of coffee.
<A NAME="kothar"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Anyhow, when we met this like Kothar Dude, I told him we
were like looking for Ninghal because a friend of a friend had a
really totally important message for her. He just looked at me funny.
I wonder what he meant by that? These new strange customs... It used
to be that if you had an important message from a friend for someone's
friend, they would give it high priority. Anyhow, we finally got to
speak to her when me and the Fairy-Chic won a B.S. contest. Everyone
else was beatin' around the subject, so I just like told her that she
might like be in perilous danger or something and we really wanted to
help. I explained that she like had to go back to her people, she
needed to be their leader, because the Chic who was attempting to lead
them now was really Bad and wouldn't help her peoples cause, or the
eventual needs of the Universe. I hope we got through to her, or at
least the mean looking metal-Giant Beast didn't scare her away from
doin' what's right. [<I>Editor's note: much of Sasfiry's account is
foreshadowing</I>]
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Kothar either did not believe or simply did not understand
Sasfiry. Nonetheless the party managed to convince Kothar that Edwin
had sent them, and that Ninghal was in danger. Kothar told them that
Ninghal was on caravan guard duty and would return that evening to
judge a public debate at 7 pm. The party was invited back to
participate in the debate and meet Ninghal.
<BR>&nbsp; Before leaving the Sanctuary the party noted one of the
patrons staring at them with an odd look in his eye. The man
introduced himself as Fry, and had caught a glimpse of the mark of
Ascension burned into Sasfiry's forearm. Fry knew more about the
meaning of the mark than the party members who bore it. As
conversation progressed seemed to know a great deal about a huge
variety of topics, though he was strangely evasive on many of them.
Nonetheless the party decided he was a useful addition to their number
and invited him to come along.
<A NAME="shards"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Investigations at several bookstores and curio shops
determined that the break-ins had occurred in the wee hours of the
morning, and had been conducted with superhuman speed. In one instance
the thieves had broken through the front window, searched, and left
before the shop keeper could run down the steps from his second-floor
living quarters. Strangely, in each shop nothing had been taken so far
as the shopkeeper could tell. The raiders had been looking for
something and had always ransacked sections of magical lore or magic
items, but had apparently not found what they were looking for (or the
shopkeepers would not admit to it).
<BR>&nbsp; In a continuing minor plot thread, Fry went rummaging about
one of the shops looking for items which had been miscategorized.
Several Anthropology rolls later he discovered a flute which the shop
owner believed was made by natives of the plains about 500 years ago.
Fry knew that the flute was actually an ancient Elvish instrument, at
least 10,000 years old. Fry bought it for some paltry sum. The flute
is encrusted with rock and will need professional restoration, but as
an added bonus the party determined it to be magical.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Sigmund's Journal</U>
<BR>&nbsp; We ken that the city branch of the Coalition library be a
likely target for the break-ins, and went to check it out. I did a wee
bit of fast talkin, and along with some conjured police documents
got the librarian to talkin. She said the main library had not been
hit. We checked in the section on magical lore and found nothing
wrong.
<BR>&nbsp; We went back to the Singing Frog Sanctuary to wait for the lass
to return from caravan duty. Its a thankless job, I've ridden a few meself.
When we walked in the cage in the corner had been uncovered, and there
were a Basilisk in there! I'll be damned but the thing were as tame as a
newborn puppy, keepin its eyes closed and its senses open for trouble.
It were checking for weapons at the door, and would raise its head to sniff
at the air if someone tried to sneak something past.
<BR>&nbsp; A bit after seven she walked in, when the crowd were thickening
up for that bloody public debate they be holding. Ninghal is a tough looking
lass, with tattoos showing her rank in her clan and history.
<BR>&nbsp; We decided the best way to get Ninghal's attention were to win
the debate. Chantille would be the best to speak for us, but her being
a fairy would attract too much attention. I worked a wee bit of magic on
her to make her look like one of the wooden men I'd seen at a carnival
in me youth [<I>Editor's note: a ventriloquist's dummy</I>]. We had a bit
of a fright when the Basilisk reared its head up at the scent of magic,
but it must have sensed that the spell be harmless and put its head back
on its forepaws.
<BR>&nbsp; Sasfiry went up on stage holdin the dummy, and together they
argued that vigilante patrols should be organized to replace the Coalition
police force which had pulled out several weeks before. I dinnae if it
was the speech, the comely looks of the lass or the general drunkenness
of the audience, but Sasfiry were judged the winner of the debate.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Using the opportunity thus presented, the party invited
Ninghal to their table and outlined the situation. Ninghal seemed
unwilling to accept the party's words, but Kothar had been convinced and
helped to convince Ninghal, saying &quot;we always knew this day would
come&quot;. As if on cue, two Sword Sisters rushed into the Singing Frog
Sanctuary. They presented a formal challenge to Ninghal, meaning a fight
to the death in the place of their choosing. The two Sisters then rushed
out.
<BR>&nbsp; Ninghal decided to try to confront the two Sisters and convince
them that the Unlife was secretly behind their faction. She requested the
party's aid in tracking them, and in restraining them once found. Fortunately
prolonged exposure to the Earthnode of their home had made both Sisters
reek of Arcane magic, which the Sanctuary's guard Basilisk was able to
track.
<BR>&nbsp; The party accompanied Ninghal across the city in the dead of
night. The Basilisk tracked the Sisters to the center square of the city,
where the party's night vision equipment picked them out attempting to
set up an ambush. As the Sisters moved stealthily around the edges of the
square, the party prepared to meet them.
<BR>&nbsp;

<A NAME="marleth"></A>
<P><U>Marleth, commander of the Coalition Garrison in Mopheus, debriefing</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The cloaked troopers in the center of the square reported that
a confrontation between the Sisters and the group of outsiders was immanent.
It was time to move. I ordered the troopers in the square to decloak and
the other units to move in. The troops in the square reported that their
environmental suit's air system kicked in, probably because of atmospheric
magic directed against them, but that was the extent of the offered resistance.
Soon enough the square was surrounded, the BattleMech was moving into position,
and the Outsiders realized there was no hope of fighting their way out.
I ordered the Outsiders to accompany us back to the Garrison.
<BR>&nbsp; I gave them the standard dressing down about violence in my
city, and then told the three Sword Sisters to leave. That left only those
who had sworn to oppose the Unlife in the room, which was what I wanted.
I explained the situation in Bazilar: that Prince Enkin was the rightful
ruler and was opposed to the Unlife, but had been imprisoned by his Uncle
Erona. Erona had sided with the Unlife. It is crucial that Bazilar not fall
into the hands of the Unlife, as that would lead the way to the entire
Fulcrumian region being dominated. I cannot move against them directly,
but this party of Outsiders (highly expendable outsiders) will have to
go there to free Enkin.
<BR>&nbsp; I loaned the Althan amongst them some equipment from the
Garrison quartermaster and sent them on their way. My scouts report
that they returned to the Singing Frog Sanctuary and hired a ship the
next morning for the trip to Bazilar.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The party thought this a rather odd encounter, but Fry
realized from the Commander's accent that he was at least a third
generation native of Kulthea, and possibly felt a great deal of
loyalty to his home world. Everyone returned to the Singing Frog
Sanctuary, where Ninghal and Kothar were engaged in heated discussion.
Both signaled that they did not wish to be interrupted, so the party
went upstairs to their rooms.
<BR>&nbsp; The break-ins at the libraries and curio shops were judged
to be worth further investigation, so some of the party (including
Sigmund, Blackhawk, Urk, and Fry) went to stake out the main library
in Mopheus. They waited from 1 am to 5 am sensing nothing amiss, and
returned to their rooms.
<BR><A NAME="crystal"></A>&nbsp; Meanwhile Frisbee ventured down into
the main room of the Sanctuary once it was quiet, to find Ninghal
sitting at a table and Kothar looking angry behind the bar. Ninghal
told Frisbee that she had spoken with the other Sword Sisters, who had
agreed to postpone their combat until all of them could return to Zor.
Ninghal gave Frisbee a shard of the &quot;Heart of the World&quot;, a
large crystal outcropping in the center of the Earthnode, which would
glow more brightly as it approached Zor. In this way the party would
be able to make its way to Zor later.
<BR>&nbsp;

<A NAME="dragon"></A><A NAME="carl"></A>
<P><U>Log of the fishing boat Uruquay, Captain Carl recording</U>
<BR>&nbsp; It were simple enough: take a group of seven adventurers from
Mopheus to Bazilar. It would be a four day trip, and they paid four
silvers each. That be more than the fishing would bring in this time of
year and the seven looked safe enough, not some group of brigands.
<BR>&nbsp; We left at dawn. That first night one of the crew noticed a
large, dark form fly over the ship, heading east towards Bazilar. One
amongst the group of seven put on a set of those Coalition far-seeing
lenses and said it be a dragon. I thought he be joking, and let it
pass.
<BR>&nbsp; The next several days passed without nothin happening. The
red-headed half-elf woman played her mandolin, several others of the
group practiced swordfighting, and the weather was calm. The small man
in the deep cloak [<I>Editor's note: Shizlink</I>] spent the entire
trip puking over the side, must never ave stepped foot on a deck
befor. I'll be damned but the puppet one of them had brought aboard
revealed itself to be a Fairy! I believed the fey-folk be myth and
legend, not real life. I was so shocked at seeing one that I didn't
'member 'til weeks later that they hadn't paid me four silvers for her
passage.
<BR>&nbsp; The Hell came on the fourth day, several hours out from
Bazilar. The evening fog came in too fast and too thick to be natural,
and was heading towards us. The fairy and the large man cast several
spells, and found that the cloud reeked of magic. I had the crew
storm-rig the ship. The Coalition far-seeing lenses were pulled out
again and showed the outlines of a larger ship heading through the
mists towards the Uruquay.
<BR>&nbsp; The black ship maneuvered along beside us and closed the
gap. The crew picked out what weapons they could, and I retrieved my
cutlass from below-decks.
<BR>&nbsp;

<A NAME="blackship"></A>
<P><U>Blackhawk's log, stardate 2474.2</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The black ship maneuvered alongside the Uruquay, and called
on us to surrender and prepare to be boarded. My answer was a
concussion grenade thrown to the middle of their deck. There was a
humanoid in full plate armor carrying a machine-gun in the center of
the deck, four humanoids dressed in black robes, and six undead
warriors. Unfortunately the grenade flew wide and blew a hole in their
forecastle.
<BR>&nbsp; The firefight began in earnest then. The one toting the
machine-gun was our primary target, and was knocked off his feet
quickly. His armor must have been pretty good by primitive screwhead
standards; he got up again. [<I>Editor's note: the armor was
magical</I>]. The four in robes were using what the natives call
&quot;spells&quot;, some kind of energy weapon. They were able to make
their target feel intense fear. The undead soldiers just got in the
way, some even died from friendly fire when the machine-gun came into
the action.
<BR>&nbsp; We concentrated our fire on the brass, the one with the
machine-gun. He only managed to get a burst off once, but hit Sasfiry
and Shizlink in that one burst. We kept knocking him down and pumping
more ammo at him. I'm surprised the deck under his feet held up after
being riddled with so many bullets.
<BR>&nbsp; It was over pretty quickly. The four in robes had big holes
burning in their chests, the undead were in pieces, and the armor had
just climbed back to his feet again. He shouted &quot;I will not
underestimate you again!&quot;, and ran off the back rail of his deck
into the water. Either he committed suicide by drowning or that
primitive looking armor was actually a combat enviro-suit, which would
also explain how he took so many direct hits without damage.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Fry's notebook</U>
<BR>&nbsp; This was bad, very bad. The priests were human, not undead.
The Unlife had never attracted living followers before. The Priests were
using Terror spells and a spell to sew seeds of corruption, trying to bring
me over to the dark side. Obviously the whole thing had been arranged to
snare me, they sent the four priests to cast their spells at me and enough
firepower to keep my companions busy. It didn't work, of course.
<BR>&nbsp; I found the rowers below decks, two dozen animated zombies chained
to their oars. The ship was inscribed with Runes to protect it and speed
its passage. I obliterated the Runes and set fire to the ship. The Uruquay
pulled away, and I watched the black ship burn to the waterline and sink.
The Unlife would have to try a lot harder next time.
<BR>&nbsp;


<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The party disembarked the Uruquay, which pulled up its
gangplank and departed Bazilar as soon as the last passenger stepped
off. Captain Carl vowed never to take on heavily armed passengers
again.
<A NAME="zol"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; The party strolled into the nearest establishment, a tavern
just off the wharf called the Randy Sea Serpent. The bartender was a
short gruff man named Zol. The obvious part about Zol was that he had
a badly attached cybernetic arm, the inobvious part (revealed by a
subtle multiscanner pass) was that he was half Grey Orc. A later
attempt by Urk to speak to him in Orcish elicited a sharp &quot;its
not wise to reveal your true nature, whelp&quot;, which was a
remarkably restrained response from a Grey.
<BR>&nbsp; An amusing interlude occurred when Pyreforge attempted to
order a drink. His customary illusion as a halfling elicited a gruff
&quot;we don't serve your kind&quot; from the bartender. Pyreforge
ducked around a corner and returned with a new illusion, satisfying
the bartender. Of course, to the party (who always saw him as a demon)
there was no visible difference.
<A NAME="bazilar"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Zol wasn't interested in talking much. He said that Erona
punished those who opposed him severely, sometimes by burning the
entire city block when any house therein was suspected of aiding the
resistance. Indeed, the party had spotted several large fires burning
deeper in the city from the docks.

<P>&nbsp; The party decided more information could be found elsewhere,
and ventured into the city towards the larger fire. The source was
indeed an entire city block burning. There was no effort being made to
put out the fire, and the family who was apparently the target of it
stood about in shock. When questioned, they could say only that the
Erona must have suspected them of aiding the resistance. Sasfiry, ever
the compassionate one, left them an entire gold piece to help their
situation.
<A NAME="kaelic"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; The party then located an Inn nearby, and rented several
rooms. The Innkeeper was a quiet man named Kaelic, who revealed that
such burnings were frequent though growing less so as the populace
collectively decided to keep their head down. The Coalition garrison
had stopped patrolling the streets weeks before, shortly after Erona
took over, and the Garrison commander had not been seen in weeks.
<BR>&nbsp; Kaelic also told of a sickness affecting Bazilar. A strange
wasting disease started in Bazilar almost ten years previous. It never
struck large numbers, but struck essentially at random with no
discernible means of transmission. The Sickness had grown much worse
of late, such that an area for the sick and dying had been set up in
the center of town.
<BR>&nbsp; When asked about the Resistance in town, the Innkeeper
claimed not to know anything but seemed evasive. A quick probe by
Blackhawk revealed an image of a kindly old man wearing glasses and
hunched over a book.
<BR>&nbsp; Sasfiry, again being always the compassionate one, gave
Kaelic a gold piece for his trouble and to help his family. The
Innkeeper got an odd look on his face and walked carefully into the
back room of the Inn, from whence a loud whoop was heard.

<P>&nbsp; The next morning the group decided to try the main library,
knowing of the odd break-ins occurring in Mopheus and that the picture
in the Innkeeper's mind had been of an old man surrounded by books.
<BR>&nbsp; Amazingly enough Sigmund's <I>False Credentials</I> spell
was not required as Fry convinced the librarian at the desk that he was
a detective from the Coalition and was investigating reports of
library break-ins in other towns. She confessed that there had been a
break-in, and that a few books from their special collection had
disappeared. When pressed, she revealed that the texts had concerned
necromancy. Fry asked for access to the special collection to assess
the damage, but was told that only the head librarian could grant such
access. Fry promptly asked to see the head librarian, whose name was
Zek. Zek lived in rooms upstairs, and had fallen ill from the Sickness
recently.
<A NAME="zek"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Fry and Sasfiry went up to see Zek. It became obvious that
Zek was the man pictured in the Innkeeper's mind. The Mark of
Ascension branded on Sasfiry's arm quickly convinced Zek that they
were to be trusted. Zek told them to seek out Baldo the Brick, who was
the city engineer working in the sewers and would know of a way into
the Garrison if anyone did. Zek also said to find Ranix at the Randy
Sea Serpent, and wrote a note which would convince Ranix that he had
sent them. Sasfiry thanked him and cast a spell to counteract the
spread of the Sickness, which at least reduced Zek's suffering.

<P>&nbsp; It would be many hours before the Randy Sea Serpent opened
for business, so the party decided to investigate the camp at the
center of town for tending those with the Sickness. It was run by the
priests of Kuar, and seemed overwhelmed with the dead and dying. The
party suspected that the Sickness might be a cover for the creation of
an army of Undead. It was decided to split up, with Frisbee and
Sigmund going to investigate the Sickness and the rest to meet Ranix
at the Randy Sea Serpent that night. Blackhawk gave Sigmund a
Coalition communicator to stay in contact.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Frisbee's report to her monastery</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The camp had been set up some years before as a temporary
triage area. Unfortunately the number of people infected with the
Sickness continued to grow, and the camp became a permanent fixture.
Brother Anthin, a priest of Kuar, informed us that the Sickness was
not directly contagious, and the method of its spread was still
unknown to them. Healing magics had been ineffective, at best slowing
the progress of the disease but never curing it.
<BR>&nbsp; On that day in particular the brothers were overwhelmed by
the number of the dead. They were loading the bodies onto a large
wagon pulled by elephants to be taken outside the city and burned.
Sigmund and I agreed to help them in their task. You will recall from
my previous reports that Sigmund is a magic-user of the High Man race,
who shows a distressing tendency in taste and frequency of his choices of
earthly pleasures but occasionally displays truly noble behavior, as
he did on this day.
<BR>&nbsp; We spent several hours loading the corpses onto the cart. They
all displayed the final symptoms of the Sickness, a strange wasting away
as though the life had slowly drained out of them. When the dead had been
loaded, three of the brothers boarded the wagon alongside Sigmund and I.
<BR>&nbsp; We rode the wagon through the city gates and for a number of
miles beyond. Sigmund carried the far speaking device given him by Blackhawk
[<I>Editor's note: a Coalition communicator</I>], and informed the rest
of our group that we would return the next day. The cart pulled up to a
natural ravine in a rocky area of the countryside. The Brothers informed
us that this area was inherently non-magical, and that those who fell to
the Sickness were brought here to be burned. It was an ignoble burial,
but necessary to remove the contagion from Bazilar.
<BR>&nbsp; Unloading the bodies was quick work, and the brothers started
the funeral pyre quickly. We stood in reverent silence for several minutes,
bidding their poor souls farewell. I recited the Lyric and the Dance of
Remembrance, wishing them well when their souls returned to Kulthea to
continue their journey along the Golden Path in their next lifetime.
<BR>&nbsp; Sigmund informed me later that he used those several minutes
to cast certain magics to assess the emotional state of the brethren. He
no longer suspects foul play by the Brothers of Kuar, believing them to
be the simple priests they appear. He also found no evidence that the bodies
of those who fell to the Sickness are being used by the Unlife. We saw
the remains of many, many years of such pyres in that canyon, with no sign
that the burnt remains had been disturbed.
<BR>&nbsp; The Brothers directed their cart towards their monastery, where
they offered us rooms for the night. The Brothers live a life close to
nature, growing their own crops and tending the sick in Bazilar. They also
have an extensive herb garden, with plants for tending the sick as well
as flavoring the food.
<A NAME="lentin"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Later in the evening we had the opportunity to talk with Lentin,
whose title is Arch-Bishop of the Brothers of Kuar. He is a good man, very
compassionate and knowledgeable. He told us that the Sickness has affected
Bazilar for far longer than Kaelic (our Innkeeper in Bazilar) knew. The Brothers
keep excellent records, and have found mention of the wasting disease stretching
back several centuries. It is clear that the Sickness became far more prominent
and wide-spread ten years ago, which is when the population of Bazilar first
took note of it. Lentin mentioned that the Coalition Garrison in Bazilar
got a new Commander ten years ago, at roughly the same time the Sickness
worsened. Lentin sees this as coincidence, but given the links we have
found between factions of the Coalition and the Unlife I believe there
may be something more sinister in that connection.
<BR>&nbsp; Lentin also informed us that Roake, Enkin's father and the previous
ruler of Bazilar, had died of the Sickness. We had not known the cause of
his death. When Enkin returned from his studies abroad after his father's
death he was immediately imprisoned, and Erona assumed the throne.
<BR>&nbsp; The next morning the brothers allowed me to take a few healing
herbs from their garden. Given the frequency with which we battle the Unlife,
such herbs are very important to us. I left a few shards of emerald as
a donation to fund the Brother's work, and we returned to Bazilar.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Meanwhile, the rest of the party left the triage area in
the center of the city, and decided to go provisioning.
&quot;Provisioning&quot; in this case is a euphemism for &quot;Sasfiry
looking for coffee and Fry looking to make Anthropology rolls in curio
shops&quot;.
<BR>&nbsp; The party ended up in a curio shop, where Blackhawk attempted
a Trading roll. A natural 66 resulted in the death of the poor merchant
during the negotiations. [<I>Editor's note: if in truly desperate combat,
offering a silver for your opponent's weapon could make all the difference...</I>]
Sasfiry and Chantille attempted to revive the trader, to no avail. The
party saw little else they could do for him save leave some money for his
family, flip the sign to &quot;Closed&quot;, and lock the door behind them.
<BR>&nbsp; Later in the evening the party went to the Randy Sea Serpent
to look for Ranix. After several hours of waiting he arrived. He was unwilling
to talk in such a public place, but when presented with the note in Zek's
handwriting agreed to meet the party at midnight on the docks.
<BR>&nbsp; Fry, being truly paranoid, had been surreptitiously watching
the other patrons in the tavern for anyone who showed exceptional interest
in the conversation with Ranix. He noticed a hawk-nosed man at a table
across the bar who had been watching. Blackhawk probed the man telepathically
and found that he was about to do something to try to impress his companions.
However he somehow detected Blackhawk's mental probe, and whipped his head
around to look directly at the party. Several minutes later Chantille attempted
a <I>Listen</I> spell to hear the conversation at the other table which
must also have been detected, as everyone stiffened and immediately left
the bar.
<BR>&nbsp; The party decided to follow these strange men. Using the multiscanner
it was easy to track them while staying well back so as to not be noticed.
The men headed directly for the docks and into a dark warehouse nearby.
A covert investigation by Chantille determined that the warehouse was empty.
<BR>&nbsp; After much fiddling with the multiscanner the party detected
a tunnel under the warehouse, heading down into the city sewers. There
were six people in a fairly large room fifty feet below ground. While the party
waited two more arrived in the underground room. The party was unsure of
what to do at this point, and as the time to meet Ranix on the dock approached
decided to leave to meet him.

<A NAME="ranix"></A>
<P>&nbsp; Ranix proved to be suspicious, but after seeing the mark on
the thoroughly drunk Sasfiry's forearm his suspicions subsided somewhat.
He thought the trio which the party had tailed from the Randy Sea
Serpent might be members of the Blood Coven, and dispatched one of his
men to investigate their movements in the tunnels under the city. The
Blood Coven is a group which split off from the priesthood. They meet
every full moon, but had not been seen within Bazilar for several years.
Their goal is to sever the link between the Druids of Tiuz and the
priests of Kuar.
<BR>&nbsp; Fry dredged a few more details from his extensive knowledge
of Kulthean history: the Druids are also known as the Wood Coven, and are
attuned to nature and the wilderness. There are seven masters of the Wood
Coven, called the Tree Druids. Their order has a policy of non-interference
in urban affairs. Tiuz is an avatar of Kuar, and the druids have always
remained on friendly terms with the priesthood of Kuar. There is another
group called the Stone Coven, 13 men and women led by the Dark Druid. They
oppose the Wood Coven, and seek to destroy civilization.

<P>&nbsp; Ranix escorted the party into a fishmonger's shop, where a tunnel
led down to an underground chamber where they could stay for the night.
In talking about the current situation in Bazilar, Ranix informed them that
when Roake died and Erona took over, the Commander of the Coalition garrison
disappeared. Strangely, no-one has been sent to replace him and the Coalition
troops now report to Erona. Patrols of troops from the garrison have dropped
to only a handful each week.

<P>&nbsp; The party relayed their findings to Frisbee and Sigmund, and
arranged to meet near the city gates the next morning. Frisbee told Archbishop
Lentin of the movements of the Blood Coven, and Lentin seemed concerned
but not surprised.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Ranix, telling tales around a campfire years later</U>
<BR>&nbsp; I thank the Gods that the group of Outsiders were with me that
day. We met the other two of their number near the gates as arranged, and
headed to an area of town far away from the Garrison and from prying eyes.
I arranged for a hay wagon to break its axle and be stranded in the middle
of the road right above a sewer grating. One by one the outsiders, Dorlin,
and I descended into the tunnels to seek out Baldo the Brick.
<BR>&nbsp; We were proceeding with good speed when the tall one, who called
himself Blackhawk, called on me to halt. He was looking intently at the
equipment in his hands, a scanner of Coalition manufacture. He said it
had located three other beings standing in the room who were not visible.
The one named Fry pulled out another scanner, and the small Fairy began
casting spells to look for the beings.
<BR>&nbsp; Suddenly a trooper of the Unlife, perhaps sensing that it had
been detected, appeared along one wall. I drew my Claymore and charged
at it before it could bring its gun to bear. The Outsiders kept to the
center of the room, drawing their weapons. It being clear that we had run
into an ambush arranged by the Unlife, Blackhawk called off bearings to
the other readings on his scanner and the group began firing to try to
feel them out. The warrior monk, Frisbee, ran with her staff outstretched
towards one of them, and dragged her staff against the wall until she located
the trooper.
<BR>&nbsp; The troopers of the Unlife were armed with firearms, and began
shooting at us from all sides. I saw flashes in the corner of my eye when
they fired, but they remained invisible throughout. I had thought that
impossible until that day. Things quickly grew grim, as Blackhawk took
a shotgun blast in the back and several others were hit. [<I>Editor's note:
Blackhawk sucked down an E critical in the back, blinked, and spun around
to return fire</I>]
<BR>&nbsp; The Priestess of Kieron, named Sasfiry, cast a spell to repel
the foul things. It did not destroy any of them, but thank the Gods it
made all of them visible! There were eight of them altogether, spread
out around the room and obviously expecting us. One of the eight was
much bigger than the rest, some sort of demon armed with a tremendous
battle axe.
<BR>&nbsp; I understand now why Edwin sent this group of Outsiders to Bazilar.
Once they could see their targets they made quick work of it, raining down
such firepower that my ears hurt from the roar. The fairy destroyed one
of the foul things by shooting a bolt of electricity at point blank range.
The troopers were protected by some sort of force shield, but in the end
it did not matter much. There were no further injuries to any of us, and
all of the Unlife were sent back to to the hell they came from.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Fry's notebook</U>
<BR>&nbsp; This was bad, very bad. The Unlife had learned some new tricks,
and were making their troopers out of sterner stuff. They began to disintegrate
almost immediately, and in the poor light I could not identify the material.
I managed to store its molecular structure in the multiscanner before it
all degraded, and I'm sure I'll be able to analyze it later given my extensive
knowledge of chemical engineering.
<BR>&nbsp; They were all equipped with a cybernetic device serving as
their spinal cord and shoulder joints, which must be where their force
fields and invisibility effects were generated. I recovered six of them
fully functional and another two which were damaged in the firefight.
I'm certain I will be able to analyze them when I can examine them in
better light given my extensive knowledge of cybernetic and electronic
engineering.
<BR>&nbsp; They also had shotguns of currently unknown manufacture. I'm
sure I'll be able to identify their place of origin when I can examine
them in better light, given my extensive knowledge of weaponry production.
<BR>&nbsp; The fact that the Unlife has singled me out for ambush is not
surprising, they realize what a grave threat I pose to them. I know they
have an extensive network of operatives searching for me. However I did
not expect them to know that I was in the sewers of Bazilar, as my movements
have been kept secret. I will have to investigate this more.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The party gathered the remains of the Necro-borgs, including
the cybernetic implants, shotguns, and the battleaxe. They continued on
deep under the city to find Baldo the Brick. After an hour of walking they
came to a Y intersection which had been recently repaired using Coalition
Durastone. Ranix and Dorlin paused, trying to determine which way to go.
They had been following subtle markers placed in the stone walls, markers
which had been covered over by the Durastone.
<BR>&nbsp; A low rumbling was heard coming from all around, and Chantille
noticed a breeze coming from one of the corridors in the Y (being a 1'
tall flying fairy makes one sensitive to these things). Fry headed off
down that corridor, calling on the party to follow him. The rest followed,
until it because clear that the rumbling was indeed a large mass of water
heading down the corridor towards them. They ran to a 4 way intersection
in the tunnel, and chose to go left to get out of the direct path of the
oncoming water. Just before the wall of water reached them a slab lifted
out of the wall beside them, and Baldo the Brick reached out to pull the
party to safety. You just knew that was going to happen, didn't you?
<BR>&nbsp; Baldo's abode, and Baldo himself, were spotlessly clean. Baldo
informed the party that the Coalition was doing extensive renovation and
reinforcement of the tunnels under the garrison, for unknown reasons. The
torrent of water they had barely avoided was intended to clean out a portion
of the tunnel system for this construction.
<BR>&nbsp; Baldo agreed to help them find a way into the Garrison to free
Enkin. He said he would arrange a meeting with Oozer, who had lived in
the sewers as long as Baldo could remember.
<BR>&nbsp; While waiting for their meeting with Oozer the party examined
the items recovered from the necro-borgs. Fry pulled up the chemical structure
stored in the multiscanner and identified it as necroplasm. Shizlink scanned
the cybernetic implants and found they were technomagical with the force
field and invisibility generated by Arcane magic. Blackhawk determined
that the shotguns they carried were not produced by any of the major arms
factories in the Coalition, and were of a design unlike any he was familiar
with.
<BR>&nbsp;

<A NAME="baldo"></A>
<P><U>Baldo the Brick</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The red-headed woman is pretty. I like her. She asked me to
help. I'll help her.
<BR>&nbsp; I'll take them to Oozer. Oozer will know a way into the garrison.
I don't like Oozer very much. Oozer is dirty. Oozer lives in the deep tunnels
with his rats. Oozer has thousands of rats. Oozer can talk to the rats.
The rats obey Oozer. Oozer will know a way. The red-haired woman won't
like Oozer. I hope she doesn't. I hope she likes me.
<BR>&nbsp; I told Oozer we need his help. Oozer does not like the new Coalition
stone. I told Oozer these people would stop the new stone. Oozer agreed
to help. Oozer said to come back that night. I have to go to work now.
<BR>&nbsp;

<A NAME="oozer"></A>
<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; According to the multiscanner Oozer was human, but it would
be difficult to tell by appearances. He was covered head to toe in matted,
dirty hair. His rats preceded him, and obeyed his commands. The party agreed
to meet Oozer that evening, when he would show them a way into the Garrison
from the sewers.
<BR>&nbsp; The party returned to Baldo's abode. Baldo, as the city engineer,
had to leave to perform his duties for the day. Ranix sent Dorlin to find
out what progress had been made tracking the Blood Coven's movements. The
party waited, sharpening and cleaning their weapons and brainstorming how
to free Enkin once they were in the Garrison.
<A NAME="dorlin"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Several hours later there came a pounding at the door. Dorlin
had returned, badly beaten and bruised. He was rushed to the bed and healing
magics administered to aid him. He recovered sufficiently to relate that
he had been ambushed while attempting to leave the sewer system. His assailants
were grey skinned and heavily tattooed, and looked vaguely Orcish. They
wanted to know about the party in the sewers, about their location, plans,
and armaments. Dorlin had fought but was overpowered and beaten. He was
able to escape when a swarm of rats suddenly rushed over the Grey Orcs,
biting and blinding them. Dorlin circled several times and took an obscure
route to get to Baldo's room, to make sure he was not followed.
<A NAME="baldogone"></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Determining that there was far less time to act than originally
planned, the party left Baldo's abode and, using the map of the sewers
their multiscanner had been making, retraced their steps to the place where
they were to meet Oozer. The scanner was able to locate Oozer at extreme
range, and indicated that Oozer was moving towards them. The scanner could
not locate Baldo, and there was little chance of tracking him down in an
unfamiliar sewer system.
<BR>&nbsp; Oozer agreed to take them to the Garrison immediately. They
traveled quite a distance, noticing more and more Durastone as they progressed.
Underneath the garrison itself almost all of the tunnels had been reinforced
with Durastone. They crossed the threshold between Bazilar's ancient system
of tunnels which had been hand dug and the Coalition maintenance tunnels
which were precisely machined.
<BR>&nbsp; Just then a maintenance droid came floating down the corridor.
Oozer hissed and spit at it, highly enraged. The droid paused and began
scanning Oozer with a green beam. It was trying to determine if Oozer was
authorized to give it voice commands, though the party did not know that
at the time. Shizlink ran up, cast a technomagic <I>Interface</I> spell
to gain access to the droid's computer system, and shut it down.
<BR>&nbsp; Shizlink proceeded to dump out whatever he could find in the
droid's memory. The droid was a construction unit, which was heading out
to pour more durastone to reinforce the tunnel system. From the construction
plans in the droid's memory it was clear that renovations of the garrison
were increasing its weight tremendously, necessitating reinforcement of
the foundation.
<BR>&nbsp; The droid also had a basic map of the garrison and of the tunnels
surrounding the garrison (which Fry merged with the map the multiscanner
had been making of the sewer system). The garrison consisted of five levels,
two above ground and three below. The lower two levels were the prison, the
middle level housed the maintenance depot (which the droid had just left)
and the kitchen. The two above ground levels were barracks and offices
for the garrison. The only access to the prison was via a stairwell and
elevator from the third floor. A separate set of stairs ran from the third
level up to the upper two. There is an entrance for the construction droids
into the maintenance depot, and a ramp leading from the lower tunnels up
to the droid entrance. [<I>Editor's note: the droid ramp and entrance are
not shown on the map below</I>] There is a trash chute running alongside
the garrison which leads into a deep underground cavern. The trash chute
has no openings on the prison levels, but could provide access to the kitchen
or to the upper two levels of the structure.
<BR>&nbsp; Oozer was going to take them to the trash chute, where they
could get to the kitchen and then sneak into the maintenance depot to get
to the prison levels. The party determined instead to try the droid's entrance
to the maintenance depot.

<A NAME="enkin"></A>

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The maintenance depot plan did not work out quite as well as
expected. Shizlink was not discovered, but a rash of mysterious system
failures placed the base on alert. After some discussion the party decided
this could work to their advantage, in that further systems failures might
be regarded as part of the overall system instability.
<BR>&nbsp; The party made its way to where the trash chute intersected
the tunnel. A doorway had been hewn and wires dangled where the electronic
lock would be placed, but the work was incomplete. A series of metal rungs
inside the chute led up to the level of the Coalition garrison.
<BR>&nbsp; The party began climbing until they were beside level five of the
garrison. From the map it appeared to be a storage area, while the main
prison cells were on level four. The multiscanner determined that there was
a security net in the Durastone lining the trash chute, in front of several
feet of rock, and finally a six inch layer of Duranium. Duranium is the material
starship hulls are constructed of, and cannot be cut with conventional
tools.
<BR>&nbsp; Eventually a plan was developed. Blackhawk cut through the Durastone
being careful to stay within the hole formed by the security wires, which
was 2 feet on a side. Sigmund and Chantille cast spells to become invisible,
and <I>Shadow Assassin</I> to cloak their movements from divination. Chantille
cast a <I>Portal</I> spell to open a temporary hole in the remaining stone
and Duranium. A quick check revealed no guards in sight, and Sigmund and
Chantille went through.
<BR>&nbsp; The fifth level was definitely not a storage area. It had obviously
been the Garrison dungeon, and was being recast as a prison. Wiring hung
from tracks in the ceiling to control boxes for electronic locks which
had not been installed. Several guards wandered through the rows of cells.
The guards wore glassy helmets which completely concealed their faces,
but their arms were grey and tattooed with runes. Later when their speech
was overheard, it was definitely Orcish. The guards were Grey Orcs.
<BR>&nbsp; There were no living prisoners on the fifth level, only a few
skeletons left over from when it was a dungeon. The elevator and stairs
to the fifth level were in a central chamber secured with a card lock.
All of the guards carried card keys, several had them stuck loosely in
their belts. Sigmund attempted to pick the pocket of one guard and failed
miserably. The Orc sensed something and immediately swung his broadsword,
but missed. Sigmund carefully crept back out of the way, and the two adventurers
waited for the guards to work it out amongst themselves. After a few minutes
the guards returned to their normal patrols. Not willing to risk another
pickpocket attempt, a guard was found sharpening his sword while leaning
against a far wall. Sigmund teleported the card key from the Orc's belt,
and the guard did not notice.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Sigmund's Journal</U>
<BR>&nbsp; We went to the central chamber and climbed the stairs. The
lock at the top had a damned camera, but the door opened even though the
bloody thing cannae see us. The prison level had cells in the floor, with
a catwalk all about for the guards. The guards could look down into any
cell at any time. There be space to walk between cells, with bars set at
the top of each. There were six Grey Orcish bastards, and four flying
metal demons [<I>Editor's note: guard robots</I>] guarding the prisoners.
<BR>&nbsp; We did a walk through the room, and found many merchants and
vagabonds but only three that we might consider bringing out with us. One
was Enkin, one was a comely lass with coal black skin and white hair, and
the last was a <A HREF="../c1/index.html#reathenor">Reathenor</A>.
The bloody huge Reathenor would not have fit through the hole between the
security wires, so we only had the two.
<BR>&nbsp; Chantille tried to fly between the bars of the cage, but I saw
sparks fly and she were thrown back. The shock broke the spell and she
faded back into vision. I grabbed her as quick as can be and snapped off
another <I>Unseen</I> spell to cover her, and none of the guards got a
good look before the spell hid her agin. They were spooked, with the four
hell-sent metal demons flying down to cast their spells [<I>Editor's note:
the robots turned on their scanner beams</I>] and the guards coming down
the stairs toward us. I used a <I>Cloaking</I> spell to convince the bastards
we weren't there, and several <I>Misdirection</I> spells to make them feel
a bit queasy besides. The metal demons were not affected by the spells,
but the guards called them off within a few minutes.
<BR>&nbsp; Chantille cast a spell to heal her injuries, and another to
project her voice far away. Enkin could only respond yea or nae, but he
blinked twice to say we should get the black-skinned lass out with us.
Chantille told both of them not to move even a wee bit, and cast spells
to create illusions of them as they lay. The little lass can create a great
deal of magic, tis true.
<BR>&nbsp; We turned to go back to the lower level when the elevator door
opened and a human man entered. He carried a silver rod and had a look
of command about him. He headed straight for Enkin's cell, though he did
not seem to realize the magics Chantille had created. I cast a <I>Misdirection</I>
spell on the bastard and saw it take effect as he swayed a bit and put
a hand to his head. We went back down the stairs to the lower level.
<BR>&nbsp;

<A NAME="leneth"></A>

<P><U>Chantille</U>
<BR>&nbsp; I could not tell Sigmund at ze time, but when I focused my
<I>Ventriloquism</I> spell on ze dark-skinned woman her eyes fluttered
open, and she spoke to me telepathically. She asked who we were, and I
told her we were going to rescue her. Zen ze woman passed out, as
though ze effort of communicating in zis manner had overwhelmed her.
<BR>&nbsp; We went back to ze fifth level, where I prepared to teleport ze
two prisoners. Ze illusions created above would last for one half of an
hour, so speed was quite important. Nonezeless teleportation magic is very
difficult especially when one is weakened from ze casting of so many previous
spells, no? I prepared ze spell carefully, and saw ze blue flash of light
outlining a male human form as Enkin was teleported.
<BR>&nbsp; I heard a commotion behind us, as several guttural voices began
to shout in what must have been ze Orcish. Sigmund whispered zat he would
go investigate, while I continued preparations to teleport ze woman from
ze cell above. Sigmund placed ze card for ze lock he had taken at ze corner
of ze hallway where ze two guards were arguing, assuming (rightly, as it
turned out) zat zey were arguing about ze lost badge. He returned just
before ze blue flash of light showed zat ze woman had successfully teleported.
Sigmund picked up ze unconscious woman, helped Enkin to his feet, and we
carefully moved back to ze place where we had tunneled through ze wall
to get in.
<BR>&nbsp; Our luck held, as one of ze two arguing guards pointed at ze
badge lying on ze floor where Sigmund had left it. I cast ze <I>Portal</I>
spell as soon as both guards had zer backs turned to retrieve ze badge.
Blackhawk, clinging to ze ladder on ze other side of ze opening, helped
us clear Enkin and ze woman through ze opening. Sigmund went through quickly
and I followed right behind him. Ze opening closed, almost catching my
wings.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The party descended rapidly down the ladder to the tunnels below.
It had taken them 45 minutes to climb up but only 30 minutes to climb down.
As they neared the bottom alarm bells were heard from above, indicating
that the illusions had expired and the escape was known. The party ran
down the tunnel into the sewers of Bazilar, finding Oozer waiting. Oozer
led them via a route they had not traversed before, as ominous rumblings
indicated that the garrison had mustered all of its resources to scour
the tunnels in search of Enkin. Nonetheless the rumblings became fainter
as Oozer led them into deep tunnels which only he knew, and eventually
the group stopped in a chamber to wait.
<BR>&nbsp; Provided with water and a bit of food, Enkin's vitality
improved greatly. He explained that the woman was some kind of
ambassador to Bazilar and perhaps to Kulthea itself. Apparently feared
greatly by their captors, she had been drugged daily and was treated
gingerly by the guards. Enkin referred to Ranix as
&quot;Captain&quot;, from which the party learned that Ranix had once
been Captain of the Guard for Roake, Enkin's father. Enkin believed
he had been betrayed by two merchants he had once trusted, who informed
Erona of his location as soon as he returned from his studies abroad.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Sasfiry, recounting her tale much later</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The extreme audacity of that total brute, Urk. Not only does
he like often berate me and like totally degrade me in comparison to Frisbee,
who gently tolerates his totally constant adoration in much the way that
one tolerates the flies when dealing with horses, but no he like must wake
MY patient to inquire about her origins and her name and other mundane
stuff. If I had a sword and the attitude to hurt others, but I like don't,
I'd thump him over the head, and I like totally told him so. Like, rude
much. First time he's shown me anything even resembling respect, got a
big-eyed look on his dufus face and walked away. Hmmm.... maybe I should
try yelling at him more often, but then again, why stress my throat. It
would like totally strain my singing voice.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The group paused briefly to allow Enkin to catch his breath
and get water, and Sasfiry to tend to the dark skinned woman. Ranix then
led the party on a two hour journey through the tunnels to a chamber used
as a staging area by the resistance movement. It had once been an underground
warehouse which was abandoned when the floor between the two levels had
collapsed. The rebels had cleaned it up and placed illusion magicks on
the entrances to hide the room's existence.
<BR>&nbsp; There were a fair number of people in the room, who immediately
gathered about Ranix and Enkin when they entered. Most of the people appeared
to be beggars and various lowlife, though Fry noticed some inconsistencies
in their clothing (a fine woolen undershirt beneath tattered robes) indicating
that many were disguised as such. The dark skinned woman was placed on
a cot in a makeshift triage area, where Sasfiry continued tending to her.
After some time the excitement over Enkin's release abated a bit, and he,
Ranix, and the rest of the rebel leadership were able to begin planning
their next move.
<BR>&nbsp; Later in the evening the dark-skinned woman awoke, the drugs
in her system having dropped below some threshold. She was able to communicate
telepathically, and said her name was Leneth, a princess of Darakon. The
coordinates of her home planet were well outside of Coalition space, at least four
jump points away. She had been sent to Kulthea because the elders of her
world detected a great turmoil nearby (the tear in space in the Kulthean
system Edwin had revealed, presumably). She was sent to establish relations
with the forces of Light on Kulthea. In her confinement in the garrison
she had managed occasional telepathic contact with Enkin, and determined
to join his struggle in Bazilar.
<BR>&nbsp; The party spent the night in the rebel stronghold. By the next
morning it became clear that the struggle in Bazilar would be a lengthy
affair, and that the party's skills would best be used elsewhere. Ranix
did fill them in on news of the Blood Coven, that it was expanding and becoming
bolder in its actions, and was operating within Bazilar itself. However
that would have to be someone else's fight. Ranix led them through the
underground tunnels to the opposite side of the city, where a manhole cover
provided access to an alley off the main commercial thoroughfare near
one of the city gates. The party had determined to travel to Zor to assist
Ninghal in her succession.
<BR>&nbsp; On the way to the city gate, Fry noticed an unassuming door
labeled &quot;curious goods&quot;.
