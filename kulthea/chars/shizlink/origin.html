<H1>Banished!</H1>
<H5>by Denny Gentry</H5>

<P>&nbsp; Shizlink was almost unique amongst the Merlogi in that his work
was not always devoted to inventions to maim and kill. His most famous
invention, and the cause of his banishment from the Merlogi, is the
Pithball.

<P>&nbsp; Shizlink found that by reducing the pith from a particular
coniferous tree to a thick stock and combining it with oils extracted from
an underground fungus, a resin was formed which quickly dried into a hard
(but brittle) slab. No known solvent would dissolve this epoxy.

<P>&nbsp; It had long been a badge of honor amongst the goblins to sneak up
to a sleeping dwarf and cut off a section of his beard to bring back as a
trophy. Very few goblins were brave enough (or could run fast enough) to
accomplish this. Shizlink found that mixing the resin and immediately
encasing it in a ball of clay kept out the oxygen which hardened the epoxy.
Thus, a Pithball could be made and thrown at the beard of an unsuspecting
dwarf. The epoxy quickly hardened, and when reinforced by the fibrous beard
hair became a virtually indestructible mass. The dwarf would be forced to
cut the hardened epoxy out of his/her own beard, which the Merlogi found
uproariously funny. It became even more hilarious when he learned of the
sacred dwarven custom of burning any trimmed beard hair. The hair encased in
epoxy would not burn.

<P>&nbsp; Shizlink discovered that any tough fiber would reinforce the epoxy
to form a superhard material, not just dwarven beard hair. He experimented
with various plant fibers and spider silks to find a good match, and
produced molds for plating to be used as armor for the Merlogi boar riders.
This would provide far better protection than the boiled leathers they had
been wearing. In this way he hoped to win the favor of his King and be
accepted more fully into the Merlogi clan.

<P>&nbsp; The day arrived for Shizlink to present his great advancement
before the King and the artificers of his clan. He began by demonstrating
the Pithballs against some Kobolds captured for the purpose. The King found
the Pithballs amazing and demanded to be given several to throw. In his
excitement the King lost track of how many he had been given, leaving one
forgotten on his throne.

<P>&nbsp; When the King sat, the final pithball burst. The epoxy worked its
way into the silk of the King's clothing. In a rage he ordered that the
perpetrator, Shizlink, be banished from his realm. The guards were all too
happy to carry out this sentence against the odd looking little one, beating
him severely and branding the marks of banishment into the palms of his
hands and the arches of his feet. They left him in the deepest tunnels near
the realm of the dwarves after beating him within an inch of his life,
hoping the dwarves would find him.

<P>&nbsp; One week later the King died a horrible death by constipation.
Shizlink's composite armor plates were forgotten and thus the balance of
power in the underground realm remained unchanged.
