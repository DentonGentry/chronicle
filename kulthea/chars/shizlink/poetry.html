There once was a round headed ranger
Who obviously knew not his danger
    He met a hobgoblin
    who chopped off his noggin
'Cause Orcball is best played with strangers

There once was an Imp who was lazy
Used to drive Dungeon Keeper crazy
    He slapped him a bunch
    And with one last punch
That Imp is now pushing up daisies.

It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
it is by the smoke of ganja that thoughts acquire speed,
the teeth acquire stains, the stains become a warning.
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

A Dwarven beard can be great fun
    especially when shorn from its wearer,
and woven into rope most fine
    to garrote its former bearer.

<PRE><I>Ode to Monofilament</I>
Monomolecular filament, buckminster fullerene,
    magnetically operated, disinfectantly clean,
monofilament is many things -- to them to you and me,
    but touch it not or you may find yourself an amputee.

Some say you should comment your code
    while others insist on a spec.
But Shizlink would rather be tortured by Orcs
    than put up with all of that drek.
