&nbsp; Shizlink is a goblin, and a <A HREF="../../tmage/">technomage</A>.
Unique amongst goblins in many ways, he was banished from the underground
realm years ago.

<BR>&nbsp; Shizlink was born and spent much of his early life within the
radius of a minor earthnode. The Arcane energy bathing the area caused a
number of mutations in the little goblin. The most obvious of these
mutations are the physical deformities: Shizlink has a full head of bright
red hair, and the toes of his feet are fully developed. His eyes have fewer
rods and cones than his fellows, allowing him to see normally in full
daylight (but also reducing his visual acuity in darkness, another reason he
was tormented by other goblins). He is rather tall for a goblin, though
still quite short by the standards of most other races.
<BR>&nbsp; The less obvious mutations are also the ones which truly set him
apart from goblin society. Shizlink is able to wield arcane magic. His mind
is quick: he speaks several languages, and can grasp advanced mathematical
concepts which would befuddle the average goblin. His powers of
concentration are enormous compared to his fellow Merlogi, allowing him to
intensely study and ultimately grasp the principles of Coalition technology.

<P>&nbsp; Shizlink enjoys writing <A HREF="poetry.html">poetry</A>. Human
readers should note that Goblin poetry now carries a Surgeon General's warning
due to the increased risk of ocular cancer noted in its devotees.

<P>&nbsp; Character sheets in <A HREF="shizlink6.xls.zip">Excel</A> and
<A HREF="shizlink6.pdf">PDF</A> formats are available.
