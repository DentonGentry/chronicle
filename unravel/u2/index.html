<H2>The Haunted Mansion</H2>
<H3>&quot;I do ney want ta know how the copper got into the dead
	rat...&quot; --Layla</H3>

Even though there was a cool breeze all day through the little fishing village
of Doverton, one would never have known sitting in the muggy common room of
the Whalers Inn.  So many people in such a small area left little room for
movement much less oxygen.  The feeling of oppression and sweat was
overwhelmed by the strange dirty creature with the group the Council had just
agreed to hire to clear out the old haunted Mansion of anything harmful to the
town. The orator of the meeting, Jem, remembered the house from when he was a
child and the local boys used to dare each other to go in.  Most had claimed
to have already done it but in truth had chickened out.  The sounds emanating
from it recently made him fear for his own boys playing the same game with the
older town boys. A recent mauling of a villager in the vicinity of the place
made it imperative that something be done.  He walked over to the five weary
strangers with a bag of coppers and a smile on his face.  He reached out to
shake hands with the young lady in traveling silks who seems to be leading
this group when in comes his old nemesis, Hughe Long, the towns richest
merchant.  How many times had there been yelling fights turned into fistfights
in the last 18 years since Hughe had first come to town.  First the problems
had been minor but continued to worse to the point of contention over a girls
affection.  And now back they were back to yelling fights over the town's
money and how to spend it.  He could see by the look on Hughe's face that one
of those fights was about to erupt.


<P><U>Dill's Diary excerpt</U>
<I>
<P>I had never expected the day to turn out such as it did.  I never dreamed
the world could be so convoluted and mixed up.  This poor fishing town was
being terrorized by a deserted haunted mansion overlooking the sea.  Lights
flickering in the windows. Strange noises and occasional screams at different
odd hours of the night.  The dead owner was thought to have come back after
over 50 years.  However, I was pleased to hear it had a lighthouse. That
prospect had drawn me to the area in the first place.

<P>I would have thought that when people truly needed help and asked for it
that the leaders of the community would wish, especially, for outsiders to
come and take care of it.  If someone gets  hurt, the populace normally won't
care much.  If the problem is made worse, it's outsiders whom are at fault. 
If it's taken care of and the task accomplished, then so much the better. It
is generally not a losing situation for elected officials.  But, Mr Long, this
rich merchant who came in at the last moment of the council meeting actually
seemed to have something personal against us.  I've never run into a merchant
that had a problem with spending other people's money for something that
seemed such a winning situation.  He finally agreed after much yelling that we
should be sent up to the haunted mansion, but with more stipulations in case
we failed than I have seen in most major contracts. It must be an election
year.  And that was only the first half of the day.

<P>I had not known any of my companions prior to the towns hiring us.  I do
not know much about this part of the world, but it seems that the thief, 
Valek, does not like to work with women.  He immediately took a shine to the
vilest beast I have ever laid eyes upon or even came within smelling distance
of.  He, or it, calls himself Nibbler.  He doesn't speak but in half sentences
and appears not to have seen soap or a comb since shortly after birth.  My
other two companions, women, Shikata and Geneva, look to have some possibly
distant relation and communicate through nods and short phrases.  The short
bits of intelligent conversation I attempted with them were not well met.  It
appears that none of my companions enjoy conversations of politics and theory
the way the Priests and Priestesses of Soquel do.

<P>Once we entered the mansion we immediately heard noises and scraping from
down a hall to our right.  I began to wonder if the tales of haunting were
possibly true and not just mischievous local bored teens, like I had initially
suspected. I saw in my companions' faces that they were thinking the same
thing.  Nibbler began muttering and a rat approached him.  When he reached his
hand to it I thought that it was going to bite him.  But strangely enough it
cocked its head, cleaned its whiskers and went off in the direction of the
noises but did not return.  Instead of the rat, a group of four humanoids came
from that direction, thus the noises.  Nibbler wandered off toward the hall
they had just come from, not concerned at all for the people or their affairs.
 An unusually tall female, Erilyn, wanted to know who we were.  She and one of
her companions, Eowyn, struck me as fairly exotic.  They communicated often
with just glances, sometimes finishing each other's sentences.  Shikata spoke
to them in the strangest almost musical tongue and they responded in kind.  A
fairly short adult female, Layla, with shocking reddish hair and the strangest
speech pattern didn't want to combine efforts to search the Mansion nor did
she trust us.  The only one that I had any familiarity with was a 6-foot tall
male who had the appearance, airs and insignia of a  Protector of the Knights
of Tuon, Mandorallen

<P>It was finally agreed that we would work together for the current situation,
since we had similar intentions in mind, and the more the safer.
</I>

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Once agreed upon the terms of the association, the party moved quickly from
room to room.  They began by searching the rooms from which the newest party
members had entered.  Little more than 11 coppers, thieves tools and tattered
clothes were found in the first room.  Valek was observed by a number of the
party members trying to pocket the coppers, and was labeled by Erilyn as a
"terrible thief".  The second room contained blood blooms, a blood thriving
flower which shoots a tubular spike into its victims, usually rodents and
birds attracted to the bright colors and rich smells of the blooms, so it will
bleed near the plants roots.  These were dispatched by Erilyn's shock bolts
and Mandorallen's arrows.  Shikata, a child of nature, could not bear leaving
the blooms to die and dug up the roots and stem of one to replant in the
forest.  A desk at the far wall of this room contained some moldy paper and a
magnifying glass of Dwarven make.  While taking inventory of the rooms
amenities, Shikata noticed that the ceiling joists have been purposely sawed
away in part of the floor area of the room above, in the area that the floor
was already sagging.

<P>When they entered the old kitchen, Mandorallen noticed that the stairs
leading up have been reinforced recently with new lumber.  The stairs leading
down went into an old basement where a body was found.  It is determined that
it was an elf who died less than eight weeks ago.  The corpse was infested
with bone worms, which did little more than nip at the party before becoming
target practice. Erilyn and Eowyn insisted the party help to wrap the corpse
in an old blanket and bring it to the front entrance to be properly buried
later.  They could not find any clan or personal identifying marks on it.

<P>From there, they headed upstairs from the kitchen and found the stairs
continued up to the lighthouse.  Erilyn floated to the top and saw a ghostly
mariner tending a ghostly fire that looked right at her before fading away. 
She saw a glimpse of light on the ocean and movement in the forest.  The party
assumes it was a boat whos lights seemed to flicked in an unusual fashion. 
Geneva managed to send the signal the pattern back after the party had lite. 
But, the boat continues out to sea. They fear it lost since a boat cannot
safely sail after dark without a Navigator aboard to interpret the Charts of
Teleron.  Upon closer inspection of the fire bed, they notice a stack of
pebbles faintly glowing with Essence.  Nibbles thought them interesting and
put them in his pocket.

<P>Since signaling the ship failed, they continue searching the second floor.
In what appears to be a master bedroom they find some semi-readable <A
HREF="1.jpg">scraps</A> of paper talking of experiments, and notice an oddity
about the wall.  After Mandorallen smashed a hole excessively easily into it,
they determined that it was hollow, with just thin sheets of wood and a thin
layer of stucco on the outside, not enough to protect from a Maelstrom.
Through the walls can be heard the ocean more clearly in this room even though
other rooms they've been in were closer to the cliff.  It almost sounds as if
they are outside just above the cliff face.  It is customary in above ground
homes to fill the walls with some sort of insulation, like dirt, to help
protect the occupants from the Maelstrom.  As they investigate further they
find two secret closets, one of which has a hand still grasping a leathery
dried up human ear.  The hand seems to be reaching for them, while still
greedily grasping its prize.  They destroy it with a Repel Undead spell and
find the room has a high instance of Taint throughout.

<P>In one of the other bedrooms they find more papers and some dangerous mold.
 A few coins are found by Nibbler in an alcove above a fireplace.  While
attempting to pocket them, he is observed by a Shikata, who shoots a blow dart
in his general direction.  The coins are handed to Mandorallen for
safekeeping, while Valek blindsides Shikata for making Nibbler a little more
wary of party morals.  In another room, they find a few giant spiders that
hungrily attack Valek. Dill justifies her pride in her marksmanship and turns
one into a pincushion while the other spider is beaten into retreat.

<P><U>Excerpt from Laylas Letter Home #103</U>

<I>
<P>At first it didn't seem practical to trust a group of five humans, one
appearing ready for a minor ball and another looking like one of the insane
ones we occasionally have found wandering the caverns driven mad by darkness,
starvation and dirt. Some of my new companions began to prove themselves. 
Dill, a Priestess of Soquel, was the most unusual of their group.  She enjoys
books, an excellent quality in any being, but she also seemed to disapprove of
wasting time and harming beings not harming you.  I trust I'll get along fine
with her.

<P>I found something out about the elves that visited us, the ones I chose to
escort through the Northern tunnels.  It seems that the sweet female, Erilyn,
used to be an Inquisitor.  Nasty business that.  She scared the bejeebes out
of some poor foolish human, Ned, we found bound and gagged in the haunted
mansion.  I still tell myself she just wanted to scare the poor fool off,
'cause it worked.  She claimed he was lying and hiding something about someone
"paying him to enter the Mansion."  If she threatened to break my fingers for
that, I think I'd dive over Mandorallens head and off a second balcony and ran
for the woods, and as Shikata later reported, the hills.  I do ney think we'll
see him again.  We did find something of interest.  It seems that someone went
through a great deal of trouble to keep or scare people out of this place. 
Blood blooms were planted inside a library area, where a desk contained a
Dwarven magnifying glass.  Ceiling joists were sawed through in this room, so
if someone stepped on the floor above them, they would fall through.   It
seems we weren't diligent enough in finding these throughout the house. 
Valek, a human thief, went crashing through them, like a clumsy fool, while
chasing after Ned in the front room.  Lucky bugger didn't break his neck. 
Also, there have been a couple of ghosts appearing and disappearing for no
specific cause; one in the hall near a decrepit kitchen, the other in the
lighthouse.

<P>It also seems that sometimes even dirty, half-insane humans are useful.  At
least this one is.  Valek calls him Nibbler, and he seems to posses an ability
to call and speak with some animals.  He called a ferret, a rabbit, an opossum
and I believe a rat.  After Erilyn killed the rat with a shock-bolt just
before we met this group, Nibbler fed the rat to the opossum after taking a
coin out of it.  How the copper got into the rat I do ney want to know.  He
also seems to have a strange sense of humor. He sent the rabbit after Ned.  He
called it his "Jack-rabbit of exceptional size" and his "35 mph fuzzy
missile".  It came back with Ned's undershorts, but not Ned.
</I>

<P>&nbsp;
<P>One of the <A HREF="2.jpg">papers</A> indicated an area below the basement,
so the party went back to reinvestigate it.  They found a secret door to a
narrow stairwell that led down nearly forty feet.  Here they heard arguing and
swearing on the other side of an old solid hardwood door.  Charging through
with swords blazing, they find two big and stupid looking fellows boisterously
discussing the disadvantages of cheating at cards and very surprised looks on
their faces in a room that resembles a common room.  Again our heroes pound
the snot out of their deadly enemy, nearly killing one.

<P>While exploring what appears to be a private bedroom, they find a hidden
tin box under a loose floorboard under the bed.  Valek again proves his
aptitude for thievery and pricks his finger on a needle trap, with the result
of having a blue stain imbed itself under his skin.  In it they found
treasures of gold, silver and copper along with a <A
HREF="4.pdf">manifest</A>, what appeared to be a list of <A
HREF="3.pdf">semaphores</A>, a <A HREF="5.pdf">note</A> from someone named
Hughe, a box containing packets of some sort of powder, and other fun things
including pebbles matching the ones from the lighthouse upstairs.  By the
warmth of the wax on the candles and the smell of smoke in the room, they
figured someone has just left this obviously private room.
