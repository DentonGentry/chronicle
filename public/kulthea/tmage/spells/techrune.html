<P>1. <B>Rune of the Howitzer -</B> A spindly rune with aerial designs.
Extends ranges of missile weapon by 10% per level (does not affect Point
Blank range). Placed on the missile, not the firing device.

<P>2. <B>Weapon I&nbsp; -</B> A rune which may be placed on armor where
it imparts +10 DB or a weapon where it imparts +10 OB.

<P>3. <B>Rune of Faraday the Mad -</B> Attracts and partially absorbs one
electrical effect (such as shock bolts or natural lightning). The attacker
must subtract 10% per caster's level from the attack. Any attracted charge
can be stored for one round per level and then dissipates harmlessly as
static electricity. While stored, the electrical energy can be "channeled"
as a power source (see the Arcane Circuit spell list).

<P>4. <B>Rune of Marconi the Confounded -</B> A largish rune with a blank
area in the center. Once activated, anything written on one rune appears
on a like rune to a range limit of 1 mile per level of the caster. Note
that two runes are required for the full effect and so the spell must be
cast twice.

<P>5. <B>Rune of Turing the Incomprehensible -</B> Selectively interferes
with the transmission of electricity within the inscribed object. Adds
+20 to Computer Technics, Picking Locks: Tech, or Computer Tapping/Crime
skills if the Rune can be inscribed on the machinery in question.

<P>7. <B>EtherRune -</B> A strange looking Rune, designed to be inscribed
on an electronic device. Will conduct low power electrical signals magically
across an intervening distance of 2 miles per level of the caster. The
amount of power carrier is insufficient to perform any real work, in practice
only communications signals can be so carried. Note that two runes are
required for the full effect and so the spell must be cast twice.

<P>9. <B>Weapon II -</B> As <I>Weapon I</I> except the bonus is +20 OB
or +20 DB.

<P>15. <B>Weapon III -</B> As <I>Weapon I</I> except the bonus is +30 OB
or +30 DB.

<P>30. <B>Rune of the Borg -</B> A very small rune which must be inscribed
on the bare skin at the back of the skull or at the left temple. The Rune
allows mental thoughts to be transmitted between the wearers of similar
Runes. Note that the spell transmits "spoken thoughts", a common language
must be used between all parties. Note that at least two runes are required
for the full effect and so the spell must be cast multiple times.

<P>50. <B>Rune of Oppenheimer the Mighty -</B> When inscribed, the Rune
brightens from a dull glow to a searing light over the course of 3 rounds.
After the 3rd round the Rune induces nuclear fusion in surrounding hydrogen
atoms. All within the area of effect suffer a 'W' Thermonuclear Critical,
and the ground is left as smooth as glass. Note that the caster is not
immune to the effects of this spell.
