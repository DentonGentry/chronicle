</TABLE>


<P>1. <B>Device Assessment -</B> Caster can assess the nature of any non-magical
item, i.e. its purpose, basic functions, etc. (Example: If the caster had
never seen a car before, he'd be able to tell it was designed to provide
motive transport and generally what kind of creatures would fit comfortably
inside.)

<P>2. <B>Interface I -</B> Allows caster to directly link his nervous system
with the circuits of a computer. It must be case before the caster can
employ the Data Access and other spells below. Computer in this sense is
defined as any sophisticated electronic computing device or control system.

<P>3. <B>Utilize Language -</B> Allows the caster to understand any one
language used by the computer currently interfaced with. This might be
necessary in order to gain access to certain data, attempt a security override,
etc.

<P>4. <B>Locate Data -</B> Caster may scan a database for spcific information
related to one key term and read one file related to that term. This is
not as sophisticated as Data Search, which allows the caster to quickly
scan through records related to the topic and select the one(s) desired.
It is not very useful when dealing with large ship or planetary databases
or with secured or restricted systems.

<P>5. <B>Data Copy -</B> Allows the cater to copy into his own memory one
file located via Data Scan (or called up using normal methods).

<P>6. <B>Technology Analysis I -</B> For each of an device's capabilities,
caster has a 20% chance of determining what the device can do. Once a Technology
Analysis spell has been cast on a device, it may not be cast on that device
again until the caster has reached a new level of experience.

<P>7. <B>Override Security I -</B> Using this spell, the caster may attempt
to bypass a level I security system. The system resists at 10th level.
Should the caster fail, he may try again in 24 hours (1 day). Once the
caster has overridden a certain security program, a regular computer operator
may then access the files. If used in conjunction with the Computer Tapping
or the appropriate Cyberdeck Operations skills, provides a +5 bonus per
level to the skill roll instead.

<P>8. <B>Data Search I -</B> Caster may search a large database for any
information which relates to a given topic, and quickly scan such for what
is desired. Concentration is required and the time needed may vary with
the complexity of the search.

<P>9. <B>Override Security III -</B> As Override Security I, except that
the caster may attempt to defeat Level II (20th lvl) or Level III (30th
lvl) security programs.

<P>10. <B>Interface True -</B> This spell bypasses the need to cast Interface
I and Utilize language and has a longer duration.

<P>11. <B>Technology Analysis II -</B> As Technology Analysis I except
the chance to determine a function is increased to 40%.

<P>12. <B>Add Data -</B> Caster may add information or commands to any
memory storage system. He cannot add information to existing files (that
is considered "alteration").

<P>13. <B>Delete Data -</B> Caster may delete part or all of one data file
or command. Programs, operating system and basic input/output files can
not be deleted. Can also be a time- or function-delayed virus with this
capability.

<P>14. <B>Override Security V -</B> As Override Security I except caster
may attempt to defeat Level IV (40th lvl) and Level V (50th lvl) security
systems.

<P>15. <B>Technology Analysis III -</B> As Technology Analysis I except
the chance to determine a function is increased to 60%.

<P>18. <B>Technology Analysis IV -</B> As Technology Analysis I except
the chance to determine a function is increased to 80%.

<P>20. <B>Alter Data -</B> Allows caster to alter the information in one
data file or command sequence. Can also be a time- or function-delayed
virus with this capability.

<P>25. <B>Purge Data -</B> Allows the caster to purge any data file, group
of data files related to a key term or any command, program, or system
file. Can also be a time- or function-delayed virus with this capability.

<P>30. <B>Technology Analysis True -</B> As Technology Analysis I except
all functions are automatically known.

<P>50. <B>Interface Master -</B> After casting this spell, caster may freely
cast any other spells on the list, one per round, for the duration of this
spell with no further rolls necessary.
