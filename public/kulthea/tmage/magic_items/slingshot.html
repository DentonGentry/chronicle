<BR>&nbsp; The Y-shaped handle contains a weapon cell and the control electronics.
The sling band is made of a nickel-titanium shape-memory alloy, while the
sling pocket is made of an insulating polymer. The shape-memory alloy retracts
into spools in the tines of the handle when not in use.

<P>&nbsp; When the sling pocket is drawn back sensors in the tines of the
handle activate the mechanism. A sudden drop in stress on the wire (as
when the pocket is released) will trigger a current through the wire, activating
the shape-memory and propelling the projectile with tremendous force. A
gradual reduction in the stress on the wire will not trigger the mechanism.

<P>&nbsp; The powered slingshot attacks on the sling table +5 with ranges
increased by 75% due to the high velocity.
