<H2>Self Guided Arrow (SGA)</H2>

<H3>also known as AFF (Arrow, Fire and Forget)</H3>
<IMG SRC="arrow.gif" ALT="Self Guided Arrow" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=135 WIDTH=304>

<P>&nbsp; In appearance the SGA is a fat arrow with a hemispherical, metallic
tip. In actuality the Self Guided Arrow is a sophisticated, electronically
controlled, self-propelled ordinance whose delivery mechanism is a traditional
longbow. When fired the guidance electronics activate the Waveguide spell
embedded therein, which creates a magnetic field extending from the missile
to its intended target. The microcomputer controls the motions of the fins
at one end of the shaft, keeping the projectile on a straight flight path
using a pitot tube and magnetic sensors fitted in the tip. One second after
launch the solid fuel booster rocket in the tail of the projectile is ignited,
increasing its speed to approximately one half of the speed of sound. Upon
impact the shaped charge warhead is detonated, sending shrapnel into its
target.
<BR>&nbsp; Due to the high velocity and guidance system, the Self Guided
Arrow attacks on the SG12 firearms table.
