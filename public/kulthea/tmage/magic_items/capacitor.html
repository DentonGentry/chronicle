<H2>Laen Capacitor</H2>

&nbsp; Laen is a magical material often referred to as "True Glass".
It is a volcanic material with a brilliant luster and tremendous
strength and toughness. It can only be worked in very cold conditions,
near the temperature of liquid nitrogen. One of the lesser known properties
of Laen is its extremely high impedence to electricity. It is a nearly
perfect insulator. Using Laen as a dielectric, extremely high capacitance
components can be constructed.
<BR>&nbsp; A capacitor is a circuit element which stores energy for a short
time. It can be used as a charge pump, accumulating energy at a low rate
for a period of time and later discharging that energy in a quick burst.
Large capacitors are used in many items of Coalition technology, including:
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>in pulsed energy weapons (such as pulse laser cannons or plasma weapons)
to accumulate the burst of energy for firing. Incorporating a laen capacitor
into such a weapon adds +20 to its attack rolls.
<LI>in servo motors to supply the energy to start the motor moving.
Incorporating a Laen capacitor increases the motor's startup torque by 20%.
<LI>in the jump engines aboard a starship to transition the ship into
hyperspace. Incorporating Laen capacitors into the jump engines would
be a revolutionary advance in interstellar technology as they could
achieve relativistic speeds as the ship entered hyperspace, cutting
transit time dramatically. However it is highly unlikely that a
sufficient quanitity of Laen could be molded on the massive scale
required for starship jump capacitors

<P>Weight: 30% lighter than Coalition capacitors of the same size.
