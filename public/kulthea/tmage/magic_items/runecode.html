<H2>Runecodes</H2>
&nbsp; Spellcasters have long known that certain languages are charged
with magical power, such that manipulations of words and concepts in the
language can manipulate the power of the essence. These languages are ancient,
primal tongues which can convey powerful ideals with grace and subtlety.
<BR>&nbsp; Mathematics is also an ancient, powerful language, capable of
great power and distinction. It is possible to devise a precise mathematical
algorithm through which wind the threads of essence, allowing spells to
be embedded and cast merely by the manipulation of the algorithm, similar
to how a glyph in the primal tongue can be written on rune paper.
<BR>&nbsp; Construction of this magical algorithm requires the creation
of a special program (the Runecode) and the casting of spells to be embedded
within it. A successful Computer Technics roll is required, modified by
the level of the spell being embedded as shown on the table below.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp; Creation of the Runecode requires one continuous hour per level
of the spell being encoded. Any interruption will ruin the flow of essence
through the algorithm and cause the Runecode to fail. After the required
time has been spent, the Computer Technics roll is made. A failure result
means the Runecode has obviously failed before the PPs are expended on
the embedding spells. A near success means that the PPs are spent when
the spells are cast, but the Runecode does not accept the spells. A new
Runecode can be constructed from scratch by spending the required time
again; this Runecode will receive a bonus to its Computer Technics roll
due to the previous near success. A successful result yields a functional
Runecode.

<P>&nbsp; A computer system of sufficient power is required to contain
the Runecode. Conventional computer systems can be used, and are capable
of storing up to 2 * their Mk number in spell levels. Thus, a Mk IV pocket
computer could hold up to 8 levels worth of spells. A Mk XX mainframe could
store up to 40 levels of spells. Enchanted computer systems can also be
constructed specifically for the purpose of storing Runecodes, which can
store thousands of levels of spells. Such magical computers are used as
spellbooks by the technomages and others, and require attunement to operate.

<P>Weight: normal for computer type

<P>Spells used: spell to be embedded and the appropriate Arcane Embed spell
<BR>Time to enchant: 1 hour per level of spell embedded
