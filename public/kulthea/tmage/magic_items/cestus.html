<P>&nbsp; Myomer filament is a type of polymer which undergoes a physical
change in response to the application of electricity. Some types of myomer
contract strongly when a current is applied, and are used to provide
the muscular strength which propels suits of powered armor and battlemechs.
<BR>&nbsp; The powered cestus is a glove made of a soft myomer fiber. When
a current is applied this type of myomer becomes rigid, approximating the
hardness of steel. There is a small control pack mounted on the back of
the cestus, which also contains the weapon cell providing the power. The
control unit is enchanted and can react to the maneuvers of an attuned
wearer such as to add +20 to Martial Arts:Strikes attacks. As an additional
benefit the cestus negates 50% of criticals which would affect the hands,
but only if the wearer can see the attack coming (the cestus is not
prescient, it only follows the mental commands of its wearer).
<BR>&nbsp; The power pack lasts for 200 rounds of active combat before
needing to be recharged. For game purposes this may be difficult to
account for, so it is recommended that the power pack be recharged once
per month.
