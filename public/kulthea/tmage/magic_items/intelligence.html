<H2>Computer Bound Intelligence</H2>
<BR>&nbsp; Technomages have developed a technique to summon and bind an
extraplanar intelligence into a computer system. The intelligence must
be interfaced to special linkage software in the computer, and must
be trained for its purpose. The intelligence will attempt to help the
system operator, and will also try to prevent any damage the operator
might inadvertently cause.
<BR>&nbsp; If using the Channeling Companion's Spirit rules, the
summoned intelligence is typically a Rational Spirit or Standard
Spirit. The GM might allow other types of Spirits to be summoned,
and modify the effects accordingly.
<BR>&nbsp; Binding an intelligence into a computer device is done in
several steps. First the device must be enchanted and the extraplanar
intelligence bound. This takes three weeks, during which time the
mage must cast <I>Empathy</I> (or a higher level spell to invest
an intelligence) once per day. Once the intelligence has
been bound, the technomage must cast <I>Interface I</I> to neurally
link to the device and begin writing the linkage software. Each
device so enchanted is different and will require a different program
(i.e. an existing linkage program cannot be copied from another
device). Writing the linkage takes an entire day. At the end of the
day an Extremely Hard (-30) Computer Technics roll must be made with
the results shown on the following table:

	<TD>The linkage program is properly constructed and functional.
	However unknown to you the extraplanar intelligence you bound
	is tainted and psychotic. It will appear to function helpfully
	but will secretly do everything in its power to bring its operator
	to ruin. If using the Channeling Companion's rules for Spirits,
	it is a particularly devious Angry Spirit.</TD>

	<TD ALIGN=CENTER>Partial Success</TD>
	<TD>You just cannot seem to get the right combination of input

	(i.e. if it would normally provide a +20 bonus this device will
	only provide +10)</TD>

<P>&nbsp; The effect of having an intelligence bound in a computer system
depends on the purpose of the computer. Any computer system can be so
enchanted, be it a pocket computer, a multiscanner, or the control system
of a vehicle. The intelligence embedded within grants a bonus to attempts
to use the equipment. The bonus depends on the level of intelligence,
as shown on the chart below.
