ince returning to Perdition things had not gone as smoothly as Pyreforge
might have hoped. The Thanes were deeply divided on how to best deal with
the rising power of the Unlife. Some, led by Malebrand (Thane of Perdition
and High Lord Marshall of the Blood March), wanted to side with the Unlife
to conquer the other Planes. Others, without a strong leader to rally them,
wanted to oppose the Unlife. The rest of the Thanes were undecided, but the
sheer personal power of Malebrand was beginning to turn the tide.
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>Pyreforge knew that to embrace the Unlife would spell the eventual doom of
Perdition. The Unlife would not be content to conquer other planes,
eventually they would turn on their supposed allies and consume them. But
Pyreforge had been away too long, ignominiously
<A HREF="../c2/index.html#pyreforge">trapped</A> by Vrama-Ver on one of
the Inner Planes. His influence amongst the Thanes was far less than once it
had been. On his side Pyreforge could count Bile (Thane of Perdition and
Prince Regent of Lemures), and Froth (Thane of Perdition and Magistrate
of the Second Circle of Fire). Malebrand had convinced at least four of the
Thanes to support him, though only the loyalty of Dominatrieze (Thane of
Perdition and Sherriff of the Putrid Grove) was unquestionable. Four more
Thanes remained undecided, preventing a majority to either faction.
Charnebolgia, the High Lord Thane, had not revealed his opinion on the
matter of the Unlife.
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>After weeks of maneuvering, the twelve Thanes agreed to meet to
decide the issue. The prevailing faction would present their case to the
High Lord Thane Charnebolgia.

	can make no claims of the strength of anything.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Pyreforge:</B></TD>
	<TD>The daughter of Kadaena is hardly a mere human.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Malebrand:</B></TD>
	<TD>SILENCE! I will not allow your cowardice to deny Perdition
	its true destiny! I offer you a choice. You will agree to an
	alliance with the Unlife, or be destroyed here and now.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Pyreforge:</B></TD>
	<TD>Hardly a choice. The Unlife will destroy us all unless we
	stop them.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Malebrand:</B></TD>
	<TD>Bad choice. (stands to his full 15 foot height, spreading
	his huge wings)</TD></TR>

	<TD>I'll rend you limb from limb and feast on your

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Pyreforge:</B></TD>
	<TD>I think not. (draws a small pistol from behind his back,
	firing shots in quick succession into each of Malebrand's
	three stomachs)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Malebrand:</B></TD>
	<TD>Bah! That tickles. You've been away too long, puny one, if
	you thought silver weapons would do me any real harm. (advances
	on Pyreforge, long blades extending from his arms)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Pyreforge:</B></TD>
	<TD>Not silver. Silver nitrate.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Malebrand:</B></TD>
	<TD>BURRP! (stops and wraps his arms around two of his stomachs,
	seemingly in pain)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2><BR>Much later, in the lair of Pyreforge.
	The Thanes had decided to stand against the Unlife.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Froth:</B></TD>
	<TD>Amazing how quickly Thanes can change their mind. All
	of Malebrand's faction save Dominatrieze suddenly had a change
	of heart.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Bile:</B></TD>
	<TD>Quite so. Quite so.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Froth:</B></TD>
	<TD>Malebrand will be out of it for a long, long time.
	He'll be unconscious for at least two years, and it
	may be centuries before his strength returns.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Pyreforge:</B></TD><TD>Yes, I know.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Froth:</B></TD>
	<TD>Excellent strategy back there. How did you
	develop the explosive magics?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Pyreforge:</B></TD>
	<TD>It wasn't magic. I learned of it during my time in
	the Inner Planes. From a goblin, of all creatures.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Bile:</B></TD>
	<TD>An uncommonly useful trick. Uncommonly useful.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Pyreforge:</B></TD>
	<TD>He is an uncommonly useful goblin.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Froth:</B></TD>
	<TD>You'll have to deal with Dominatrieze some day, you know.
	The same trick won't work on him, I'm sure he's developed
	a new rune of protection by now. I know I have.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Bile:</B></TD>
	<TD>One problem at a time, Froth. One problem at a time.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>The legions of Perdition began to organize and train with the extensive
arsenal of Coalition weaponry Pyreforge had procured. The Thanes, at first
reluctant, began to anticipate the glorious war to come.
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>Ammonia rapidly fell out of favor as a delicacy in Perdition.
