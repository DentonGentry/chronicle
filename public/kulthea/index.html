<H2>The Kulthean Campaign</H2>

<P>This page contains supplementary material for a Rolemaster game
run by Marc Mangus.
The campaign was set on Kulthea (of 
<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/terbob/index.html">Shadow World</A>
fame) which was conquered five hundred years ago by an interstellar
empire called the Coalition. This campaign is now on permanent hiatus.


<P><H4>The Chronicle</H4>
Our group keeps a record of its adventures, told as a story. Here
are the episodes thus far, and the date of the latest substantial
update to their chronicle.

<P>
Marc runs the campaign as an epic saga, with certain sub-plots
running through the adventures. Some of the 
<A HREF="unanswered.html">unanswered questions</A>
from these subplots are listed on a separate page. Notable
<A HREF="items/">items</A> recovered
in the adventures are described, as well as important
<A HREF="personages.html">persons</A> encountered.
There is also a rough
<A HREF="timeline.html">timeline</A> of the
adventures. Loremaster Edwin, the main patron of the party, has his
<A HREF="edwin.html">own page</A>.

<P>
<H4>Chronic!</H4>
Even Chroniclers need a distraction sometimes. Thus is introduced
Chronic!, tales of adventures which are almost completely but not quite
entirely wrong.
<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="2">

	<TD>Chronic 1.0</TD>
	<TD><A HREF="chronic1/index.html">

	<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>9/21/98</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Chronic is a spoof of some of the Chronicle tales, and will not make
sense unless one is familiar with the original.

<H4>Other Passages</H4>
The same gaming group subsequently played through <A HREF="../rtoh/">The Return to the Tomb of Horrors</A>, set in the world of Greyhawk. The group then moved on to <A HREF="../unravel/">The Unravelling</A>, which has also now concluded.

<P>The group is now playing in a new campaign set in the world of <A HREF="../greyhawk/">Greyhawk</A>.
