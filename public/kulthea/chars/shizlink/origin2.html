<H1>The Goblin Got Away!</H1>
<H5>by Marc Mangus</H5>

<BR>&nbsp; An outcast from his people virtually from birth due to his
freakish appearance, Shiz' spent much of his formative years alone doodling
with increasingly complex mechanical devices.  The Merlogi artificers became
threatened by the simple grace and beauty (by their standards) of his
designs as he became of age and worked to further undermine his already
fragile place in the clan.  Little did they know that the little malformed
goblin was an open gate to the swirling Essaence of the world...

<H4>Tolkemak, Arch Techno-Mage of indeterminate age and race</H4>

<BR>&nbsp; Tolkemak is a wizened old man too short to be any of the standard
mannish races and too tall to be of the Shire or one who frequents the
Underdark realms.  He has a biting sense of humor and loves practical jokes.
His jibes and pranks are not idle however, and always seem to lead the one
on whom they are perpetrated to greater understanding of the world around
them.  No one knows how old he is but his tales of the Second Age seem
unusually vivid.  He speaks of the great Loremaster Andraax as if he
actually knew him.  He also tells of the time when the Coalition came to the
world and the failed efforts of the Alchemical Guild to understand their
strange Magiks.
<BR>&nbsp; Only taking a charge once an age, Master T found young Shiz' near
death one day in a remote tunnel.  Tolkemak and his helper Borivan were on
one of his months long excursions through the Underdark in search of rare
deposits of materials for his Arcane manipulations.  The Dwarves, Goblins
and other denizens of the deep had long ago learned to leave the Master
alone since he was no threat if not interfered with.  Tolkemak immediately
saw the dance of probabilities swirling around the young Merlogi and decided
it has been long enough since his last charge, Ari'amax, had left the fold. 
He had Borivan gather up Shizlink and cutting his trip short, returned home.
<BR>&nbsp; Tolkemak made his home, of course, in a Place of Power.  Among
the tangle of roots and boulders 'neath the trunk of a great Tree of Life,
only a few of which exist in the world, he worked for decades to forge an
inviolate sanctum.  The Tree itself was impossibly old and had nearly
consumed the power of the Earth Node on which it sprouted.  Tolkemak made
his home in complete harmony with the Tree, always returned to it more power
than he consumed.  Over the years both had come to regard the other as
somewhat of a Guardian or keeper and shared many secrets.  The Tree also
made his many Arcane alchemical and techno-magical manipulations virtually
undetectable from the outside.
<BR>&nbsp; It was to this place he brought the ailing Shizlink and nursed
him back to health.  Having been taught to mistrust everyone, at first the
Goblin was alarmed and looked for means of escape.  He soon learned to trust
the Master as his health and personal power increased.  He was also held
captive by his fascination of the wondrous devices bedecking the Master's
sanctum.  His tutelage with the Master was difficult and taxing.  He had to
venture far and wide on many missions for the Master.  These trips included
going above ground during the daylight; something that was anathema to his
people.  After a few years, Shizlink came to the realization that these
trips were meant to teach him about the world and not to collect items or
information for the master; he was far beyond any aide Shizlink could
provide.  After this, though the workload didn't decrease, it was much more
bearable.  Shizlink began to experience something almost all the time that
he only had in brief periods before: happiness.
<BR>&nbsp; One kind of mission Shizlink always found the most confusing
until he made his great epiphany.  The master would have him sneak into
surrounding farms in the dark of night, find broken equipment or devices,
and fix them using his increasing knowledge of Techno-Magic. Sometimes he
would find offerings of food, coins or other precious baubles near the
broken item he was to fix.  He always brought them back to the Master
thinking this was how he made money.  Once he knew enough of the world to
know how valuable the Master's devices were however, he realized how
ridiculous this idea was.
<BR>&nbsp; It was on one of these missions that Shizlink's life took a turn
for the worse.  He was struggling to fix an old well pump powered by
internal combustion one night.  No matter what he tried the cursed thing
wouldn't keep running.  Since it was in a covered well house Shiz' didn't
notice the sun come up, so intent was he on his work.  As he replaced the
motor's cover for the tenth time and tried to start it, it popped, sparked
and burned out completely.  He finally lost control and screamed all the
curse words he knew in any language.  His tirade was interrupted by Human
voices shouting.

<P>Male voice 1: &quot;What was that?!  I thought you told me there was no one
else on the farm!&quot;
<BR>Male voice 2: &quot;There isn't, I swear!  I don't know what that is!&quot;
<BR>Male voice 1: &quot;You know the penalty for avoiding the Tax.  If you can't
	pay for everyone you'll have to send someone to work in the mine!&quot;
<BR>Male voice 2: &quot;NO! Please, I beg you!  I only have one son!&quot;
<BR>Male voice 1: &quot;Shattup!  Browken, go look in the well-house!&quot;

<P>&nbsp; Shizlink was paralyzed with fear.  There was no place to hide in
the small building and a Browken (whatever that was) was coming for him. The
door flew open and a human man wearing armor and carrying a strange, deadly
looking stick framed the doorway.  "This must be a Browken" he thought.  The
man was shocked by seeing a Goblin in the daylight but only for an instant. 
He raised the stick he was carrying and pulled the trigger.  Shizlink's body
felt as if it caught fire.  Every nerve spasmed and every muscle contracted.
 Thankfully the intense pain was followed by blackness as he passed out.
<BR>&nbsp; The Merlogi lost track of time as he lapsed in and out of
consciousness.  At one point he remembered laying on a cold, steel slab with
bright lights shining above.  Some strange creatures dressed in white loomed
above him and seemed to be poking him with something although he couldn't
feel it.  Sometime later he awoke in a bare, square room.  His face and
throat ached as if he had been beaten and when he breathed it felt somehow
different.  He stayed in this room for some time.  Every day (he assumed) a
small door opened up and a small pellet was pushed in.  After a few of these
had piled up and he began to get very hungry he discovered they were a very
bad form of food.
<BR>&nbsp; Then his confinement ended.  Two large humans came into his room
one day and fitted him with metal boots that had magnetic collars at the
ankles and a green pulsing light on the side.  They marched him out into a
hallway that became increasingly rough as it descended.  Finally he was put
into line with a great many other creatures in a long cave tunnel.  He
recognized Dwarves, Orcs, Gnolls and even other Merlogi. They all had the
same droopy, subdued expression.  He pushed on the Merlogi next to him and
whispered to him in their own language.  The other Goblin barely reacted. 
Then, one of the humans that brought him here yelled &quot;Hey, you little
kruz-ball, no talking!&quot; and pressed a shiny silver cylinder to his neck. 
After that he began to see how important it was to work in the mine and not
talk to the other creatures.  In fact, he couldn't wait to go down there. 
After a time, they marched down into the poorly lit tunnel.  He could almost
feel the rock breaking under his efforts...

<P>&nbsp; Never seeing the Sun and being drugged out of his mind most of the time
contributed to a feeling of timelessness.  Shizlink went with the other
Merlogi and some Gnolls into the deepest parts of the mine.  In these
tunnels the air seemed alive with strange smells.  Sometimes the humans
would come down wearing suits with some kind of breath filters in them. 
The smells didn't bother Shiz' that much but sometimes it was a little
hard to breathe.  One day as the work team dug deeper into a particular
tunnel, the Gnoll to his right struck his axe into a vein of mineral or
metal.  As the metal head of the axe bit into the stuff.  The sound
seemed to echo though the air to Shiz' skin and bone into his very
sould.  For an instant he could think a little more clearly, then his
mind clouded again.  The Gnoll continued blithely along striking the
rock, the vein, then the rock again until Shizlink thought he would go
insane from the effects.  Knowing Gnolls to be notoriously lazy, he
offered to work during its break period.  The Gnoll quickly agreed. 
Shiz' worked hard on the vein and broke loose some pieces of the strange
mineral.  He stuffed them in his mouth and took them back with him to
his bunk.  He began storing these chips under his bunk until he
accumulated a small pile of them in a few months.  The Master had just
begun teaching him of devices that could store power and he began his
meditations again with the rocks under his pillow.  He would awake
completely lucid during the night.  It was thus that the plot to free
himself began...
