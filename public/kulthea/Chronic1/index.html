aving freed Ernie from the deepest dungeons of Bert, our heroes
returned to Edwin's shop to determine the next step in saving the
universe. They had only just entered and not even made it to the donut
table when the door swung open. A tall man dressed in black leather
strode into the room looking intently at a device on his wrist. A
label on his coat said "Prophet", though it was not immediately clear
if this was his name or occupation.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P>&nbsp; Startled, Blackhawk fired the Plasmanator at the
intruder. The angry ball of superheated hydrogen punched through the
wall to Prophet's left, across the alley and through the brick wall of
the warehouse beyond, burrowed through the imported glassware stored
within and out the other side, through several assorted dock buildings
(scorching the dockmaster's hat as it went by) and was last seen
heading south over the ocean towards Emer.

<P>&nbsp; The recoil from the plasmanator sent Blackhawk flying
backwards over Edwin's desk. "I like this gun!", he exclaimed as he
clambered back to his feet.

<P>&nbsp; At this point Edwin intervened, calculating the astonishing
repair bills were Blackhawk allowed to continue. "Ah, Prophet", he
said, "I've been expecting you. I believe you have a message for our
guest?" Upon hearing his name Prophet looked up from his Nintendo
WristBoy, causing him to lose the game of Tetris. He swore under his
breath at the inconvenience of having to take these blasted delivery
jobs. If it hadn't been for the run of bad luck at the Baccharat table
none of this would be necessary and he would never have had to deal
with these primitive screwheads on their pathetic planet. He could be
back in a holosuite on Cestus 3 surrounded by beautiful women and
drinking the best Brevari the universe had to offer. Of course, that
isn't what he said. He said, "Yes."

<P>&nbsp; "Right, Pyreforge is being summoned back to the Third Carnal
Pit, isn't he?", quipped Fry. "It is as I've suspected all along, the
hierarchy of Perdition is part of the conspiracy."

<P>&nbsp; "Um, yes," said Prophet, "What conspiracy?"

<P>&nbsp; "Wouldn't you like to know."

<P>&nbsp; Pyreforge came in from the back of the shop and was handed
the message crystal. Pyreforge inserted the crystal into, erm, well
nevermind where he inserted the crystal. "Jumpin Jimminy Christmas!"
he said... Well, actually, that is not what he said but this Chronicler
would feel compelled to rate this narrative as unsuitable for the
younger members of the audience were he to transcribe what Pyreforge
really said. "I've got to get back to Perdition!", he announced, and
promptly disappeared in a puff of sulfur.

<P>&nbsp; "Finally!" said Edwin. "Do you have any idea how much he
eats!?! Mathilda had to go to market twice a day to keep up with him.
Talk about overstaying your welcome!"

<P>&nbsp; Suddenly Chantille, who had not been paying nearly enough
attention to the drifting puff of sulfur, coughed and spat as it
enveloped her. Overcome by the stench she passed out on the floor.
Sasfiry ran over to help, and Shizlink ran out back to fire up the BBQ
grill. Fortunately Sasfiry was able to revive her before Shizlink
returned to start cooking.

<P>&nbsp; "Could we please get down to business now?", asked Edwin.
"You freed Ernie from the clutches of the evil Bert, which is good.
Now I want you to go to a stronghold of the Unlike ... "

<P>&nbsp; "Don't you mean a stronghold of the Unlife?", asked Fry.

<P>&nbsp; "No, the Unlike. They are Unlike us, so we kill them.
Capiche?", continued Edwin. "I want you to go to a stronghold of the
Unlike in the First Pail ..."

<P>&nbsp; "Don't you mean the First Pale?", interrupted Fry.

<P>&nbsp; "No, the First Pail. Its an enormous metal bucket on the
north coast of Emer. It appeared there suddenly about ten years ago,
though none of the Loremasters can remember precisely when. Of course,
that was just after Lysander the Clever threw that party to celebrate
his enchantment of the Everfull Wine Cask, and that whole year is kinda
fuzzy for us. I want you to go recover from the Unlike a portion of
the Fart of the World."

<P>&nbsp; "Don't you mean the Heart of the World?", asked Fry.

<P>&nbsp; "No I mean the Fart of the World. A portion of it in a
sealed box was captured by the Unlike. Whatever you do, don't open the
box." concluded Edwin. "You can leave after the Gathering of the
Ascension tonight. It looks to be quite a bash."

<P>&nbsp; There was a little time to resupply before the Gathering.
The party left Edwin's shop and headed for the marketplace. As they
passed the warehouse across the street Frisbee noticed an urchin
selling fine glassware, slightly melted. She bought a goblet which was
untouched save for a tiny hole melted in the side, thinking to play
the "give the dribble glass to the half-orc" trick on Urk. Little did
she know how fortuitous the purchase of that goblet would be.
[<I>Editor's note: that was not foreshadowing. Nope nope nope, not one
little bit.</I>]

<P>&nbsp; The city market was bustling with activity as was usual at
midday. Sasfiry set out on her never-ending quest for coffee (black,
with sugar, with cream, <B>any</B> way she could find it), and Sigmund
for whatever alchoholic beverages were available. Fry started making
Archaeology rolls before he even reached the first curio shop. He made
a good roll, so if he manages to locate an appropriate shop it should
be a doozy.

<P>&nbsp; Blackhawk and Prophet, having put aside their differences
over that little plasmanator incident, went in search of ammunition.
Lots of ammunition. Ammunition for the plasmanator, for the Enforcer,
for handguns, for rifles. Ammunition for weapons they didn't even own
but planned to. The NRA would be proud (if it maintained a branch
office on Kulthea, that is).

<P>&nbsp; Wandering through the stalls, in an incredible reversal of
statistical probability Shizlink made a long series of 66 rolls in
Trading maneuvers resulting in the death of the entire row of
fishmongers. "Mmmm, bad shellfish", said Shizlink. Spoiled shellfish
is a delicacy amongst Goblins. Shizlink spent almost an hour searching.

<P>&nbsp; Sasfiry was of course unsuccessful in her quest for coffee,
and it really bummed her out.

<P>&nbsp; Returning to the shop, the group learned that the Gathering
of the Ascension was to be held in Edwin's back yard. "We don't have the
budget to rent a banquet hall!" was Edwin's response to any question
regarding the venue. The Gathering consisted of those beings sworn to the
Ascension serving the side of Like in the struggle against the Unlike.
It had all your normal Gathering arrangements: music, food and so on.
But the very centerpiece of the engagement was, of course, the
aforementioned Everfull Wine Cask. Sigmund personally drank over twice
his body weight (fortunately the RMSS lacks an Alchohol Poisoning
table). "Y' o'nl' ren' ushka ve!", he said loudly to anyone who would
listen, as if anyone could understand that bloody thick brogue of
his.

<P>&nbsp; The next day, having no excuses left to delay the mission,
the party gathered their stuff and headed into the fields outside of
town. Blackhawk and Fry had to carry Sigmund who was still sleeping
off the effects of the Gathering. Reaching a large flat clearing they
laid down on the ground, waiting for Urk to summon the Navigator.

<P>&nbsp; "I require a Navigator", said Urk in The Most Ancient and
Dead Tongue of Upper Fulcrumia (The Bronx Side, not Queens).
Immediately the creaking of riggings could be heard as the flying ship
approached from the west.

<P>&nbsp; "Wow, that was pretty impressive", said Frisbee, "you got it
on the first try."

<P>&nbsp; "Natural 100. Do it all the time.", shrugged Urk.

<P>&nbsp; The ship came to a stop and descended until it was 20 feet
above the ground. An ancient High Elf clad in a full suit of plate
mail strode to the edge of the deck and called down: "I am Piladon,
the Navigator." He made a funny, sortof tearing cloth noise as he
walked. Piladon stated the price for a trip to the northern coast of
Emer: 50 gold pieces. Feeling that was highway robbery, Sigmund moved
into haggle formation. Several trading rolls later the price was 100
gold. Sigmund vowed to never again make trading rolls while hung over.

<P>&nbsp; Counting their monies, the party determined that they could not
quite pay for the transport. The vast majority of the wealth gained
in their previous adventures had gone to pay off the awe-inspiring bar
tab at the Gathering of the Ascension, leaving 98 gold pieces. Two
incorrect assumptions made the party decide to take transport with
the Navigator anyway: 1. surely Piladon wouldn't quibble over
two gold pieces (<I>He would</I>), and 2. he looked pretty scrawny,
surely they could take him (<I>They couldn't</I>)

<P>&nbsp; Scrambling up the ladder, the group took off for
<STRIKE>Aranmor</STRIKE> Emer. The funny tearing cloth sound persisted
whenever Piladon moved, as if he were constantly bursting the seams of
his trousers. They sailed over the ocean, over the fishing boats,
migrating whales, and offshore oil platforms, and within a few hours
caught sight of the coast of Emer. Spotting an enormous structure
glinting in the fading sunlight they directed Piladon to fly over the
edge and descend to land. Piladon, of course, had other plans. Shortly
after crossing the threshold of the First Pail, he made an
announcement.

<P>&nbsp; "End of the road", said Piladon.

<P>&nbsp; "What?", said Urk.

<P>&nbsp; "No more taxi ride. Vamoose. See ya!", said Piladon, "The
meter on my dashboard now reads 98 gold pieces, which means you just
ran out of money."

<P>&nbsp; "Like, how did you know we only had 98?", asked Sasfiry.

<P>&nbsp; "Multiscanner pass as you came aboard. Now off with you!",
said Piladon.

<P>&nbsp; "But, we're at least a mile above ground!"

<P>&nbsp; "Having to climb a ladder to board should have clued you in:
this is a flying boat. It does that.", explained Piladon, who then
spun the ship's wheel causing the vessel to list to starboard. As the
ship slowly rolled the party members began to slide down the deck,
grasping desperately at whatever handholds presented themselves.
Piladon's armor, of course, used a magic adhesive Velcro&copy; on the
soles of the boots to keep him firmly attached to the deck, which made
the funny tearing cloth noises. He had used this passenger
disembarkment technique before.

<P>&nbsp; Clutching desperately at riggings, the party members managed
to hold on until the flying ship had rolled completely over, when it
began to shake violently. Piladon was moving the wheel back and forth
rapidly to fling them off. One by one they dropped away from the
ship, plummeting downwards towards the floor of the First Pail nearly
a mile below.

<P>&nbsp; "Great, like now what do we do?", asked Sasfiry, not really
expecting an answer.

<P>&nbsp; "I've got it! I've got it! All we have to do is embrace the
wisdom of Penderack! If we overcome doubt, we'll stop falling!",
exclaimed Fry.

<P>&nbsp; <I>Even the GM had to frown at this one. How did Fry know that?
It was in his notes only to counter claims from distraught players
that he had led them into a certain death situation. How did Fry know
about it?</I>

<P>&nbsp; "Wouldn't you like to know", said Fry, to no one in particular.

<P>&nbsp; One by one, the adventurers overcame their doubt and slowed
their descent until they hovered in a small group about two thousand
feet above the floor of the Pail. All except Sigmund, that is. "Y'
bastaaaaaaaaaaaa...." was all that was heard of him as he plummeted
downwards out of sight.

<P>&nbsp; Descending slowly, the rest of the party followed Sigmund
down. There was a strange, vaguely unpleasant smell permeating the
interior of the First Pail. It smelled rather like the morning after a
really good fraternity party. The smell grew stronger the closer to
the base they went, until it was quite pungent at the floor. There
were puddles and shallow pools of a strange amber liquid collected in
small dents in the floor of the Pail. Chantille spotted Sigmund's body
floating in a particularly large pool of the stuff, and as a group
they went over to retrieve it since he was carrying quite a bit of
equipment.

<P>&nbsp; "I'T BEER!" yelled Sigmund as he treaded in place,
obviously overjoyed. He had landed in a particularly deep pool of it
which had broken his fall without injury. The pool had grown
noticeably shallower in the time it took the rest of the party to
descend. Sigmund can put away a lot of beer.

<P>&nbsp; Unbeknownst to the party, and unbeknownst to the Loremasters, and
in fact unbeknownst to anyone save this Chronicler owing to the fact that he
is just now making it up, the entire First Pail had initially been filled
with a particularly subtle but noxious alchoholic substance. The invasion
plan of the Unlike had been to transport the First Pail to Kulthea along
with an enormous "Free Beer!" sign. The resulting stampede of eager
beer-swillers to Emer would leave the planet defenseless and ripe for
conquest (the Unlike had read the history of the Trojan Horse).
Unfortunately in one of those cosmic ironies the Pail and sign were sent
separately, and the sign alone was affected by an astral burp which reduced
it to 1/1000th of its intended size and deflected its course so that it
landed outside the Wizards Of The Boast tavern in Mopheus. The resulting mob
of thirsty sailors tore the place apart when told that there was no free
beer in the establishment and what the hell were they babbling about anyway?
The First Pail had begun to leak shortly after its landing, draining its
harsh contents into the ocean where the trade currents carried it north to
the port city of Bazilar where it had seeped into the local water supply,
causing a mysterious Sickness which torments the residents of that fair city
to this day.

<P>&nbsp; As Sigmund continued to lower the level of the pond he
landed in, Urk noted a bright light off in the distance. Lacking
anything else to do the group headed towards it.

<P>&nbsp; As they approached they saw the source of the light was
a large fire in the middle of a strange round altar. Standing in a
circle about the fire were an odd assortment of creatures: two
large red demons with cybernetic arms, a humanoid lizard wearing a
horribly stained bathrobe, and a dude in black plate mail. All of them
held at arms length a long, thin metal blade which appeared to be made
of duranium. The blades dipped towards the flame in unison, evidently
in some sort of ritual controlled by the lizard. Planted firmly at the
end of each blade and being held over the fire was a largish
marshmallow. Occasionally the lizard-man would check the condition of
each of the marshmallows by flicking his forked tongue over them. The
cyberdemon on the right stiffened slightly when this happened,
obviously not appreciating someone else sampling his tasty snack, but
said nothing.

<P>&nbsp; Prophet, rather upset at his scant mention in the story thus
far, immediately opened fire with his wicked-looking sawblade launcher
of doom. The blast ripped through the first cyberdemon, cutting it
neatly in two. Inexplicably given its situation, the last thought
which coursed through its cybernetic brain was, "Damn, now the
lizard's gonna eat my marshmallow."

<P>&nbsp; The rest of the minions of the Unlike spread out and returned
fire. The other cyberdemon raised both arms, which were outfitted
with an odd-looking attachment of paper-mache funnels and tubes.
The cybernetic weapon system was designed to fire a highly compressed
energy bolt which encodes the complete and unabridged text to
Chaucer's Canturbury Tales. The blast of literary greatness struck
Frisbee in the midsection and infused her brain with dense, incomprehensible 
gobbledygook. The resulting intellectual dissonance would have killed her
except that the last chapter was deflected when it hit a peculiar facet
of the goblet she had purchased the previous day. [<I>Editor's note:
ok, maybe it was foreshadowing</I>] Instead she dropped instantly into a
coma while her conscious mind went off to puzzle it all out.

<P>&nbsp; Urk, Prophet, and Fry simultaneously returned fire on the
cyberdemon. In this case the pen is not mightier than the sword and
the demon bit the dust.

<P>&nbsp; The dude in black plate reached over his shoulder to draw
the dreaded fully automatic reciprocating sharp object flinger. He
took aim at Black Cross, who strangely had chosen to wear a red
turtleneck with a gold Star Fleet insignia on the chest. With a loud
roar thousands of razor-sharp utensils poured forth from the weapon,
vivisecting Black Cross in an instant.

<P>&nbsp; Despite the combat raging nearby the lizard spellcaster had
maintained his concentration on the ritual. Blackhawk put a stop to
that through the good work of the Plasma Repeater Rifle; all that
remained of the lizard was a smoking pair of boots (&quot;I like this
gun!&quot; --Blackhawk). &nbsp; <I>Yes, that last bit was lifted
intact from the real adventure. I couldn't improve upon it.</I>

<P>&nbsp; Grinning like a banshee, Blackhawk next levelled the
plasmanator at the dude in black plate and pulled the trigger. Nothing
happened. The weapon status display indicated that Blackhawk had
already received the maximum radiation dosage for one day and the
safety system had kicked in. "Damn", he said, "I gotta get Shizlink to
disable that". Dropping the plasmanator Blackhawk reached for his
backup weapon, a double-barrelled recoil compensated gyroscopically
stabilized fully automatic combat shotgun loaded with self-propelled
heat seeking sabot rounds and equipped with laser sight, tuned
headers, a glasspack muffler, and fuzzy dice hanging from the trigger
guard.

<P>&nbsp; Amazingly, given his inebriated state, Sigmund realized that
the flame in the center of the altar was in fact issuing forth from a
small metal box at its center. The Unlike had made a hole in the box!
He staggered in a more or less straight line towards the pyre which
became rather less straight the closer he staggered until he was
actually circling it. Determining to stop this circling nonsense he
quite deliberately tripped over his own feet and fell, hitting his
head on the altar. "Ow, me crania", he said.

<P>&nbsp; Meanwhile Fry, who had known all along that the box had been
punctured to release the highly flammable Fart of the World, traipsed
lightly through the firefight, dodging bullets and assorted dangerous
things, to arrive beside the still dazed Sigmund. "Klaatu, Berada,
Niktu!", said Fry, activating the ancient Arcane enchantment on the
box which would seal it once again and thus put out the flame.

<P><I>The Master of Time, Space and Dimension was displeased.
How the hell had Fry known that? The third word, Niktu, the word which
kept the box from imploding and causing a chain reaction which would
destroy the world, wasn't written down anywhere! How did Fry know of
it?!?</I>

<P>&nbsp; "Wouldn't you like to know." said Fry, to no one in
particular.

<P>&nbsp; The situation looked grim. Multiple blasts from all of the
party's weaponry had proven incapable of scratching the black plate
mail worn by the final minion of the Unlike. Said minion was actually
taunting the party now by mooning each in turn and quickly pulling his
armor back up before being hit by their volleys. However he seemed to
be tiring of that sophomoric prank. As he raised his fully automatic
reciprocating sharp object flinger, a loud retort was heard from one
of the steel panels of the First Pail as it began to glow red from
heat. Suddenly an angry ball of superheated plasma melted its way
through and streaked toward the dude in black plate, striking his
helmet straight on. You see, back in Edwin's shop Blackhawk had
open-ended his plasmanator attack roll 37 times.   Even after the
-2000 penalty for the "Only In Your Dreams, Cowpoke" range category
and -1500 for the DB of the black plate mail, there was still enough
left to do 'A' heat, plasma, and unbalance criticals. The black plate
mail negated the heat and plasma criticals, leaving the unbalance
which resulted in its wearer being bowled over and knocked
unconscious.
