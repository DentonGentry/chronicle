ineas felt something cold and sticky brush his leg. The invisible demon, its
foul secretions darkening the coating of flour to a light brown, was beginning
to stir. The demon moved stiffly and reacted slowly: it had spontaneously
reanimated as a zombie due to the close proximity of the Negative Material
Plane. Fineas hit it with a <I>Lightning Bolt</I> while Zem charged in with
his broadsword. It slashed at Fineas with its claws and pincers, knocking him
to the floor with serious wounds. Sensing trouble, Rosvenir and Mystical
teleported back from the demon's lair to counter the renewed threat.

<BR>&nbsp; Kurik's <I>Repel Undead</I> failed. Reinforced by the powerful
negative energies of the Plane, it was all but immune to such spells. More
mundane means would have to suffice. To that end Zem slashed at it and
Rosvenir cast <I>Flash</I> to blind the creature. Kurik cast <I>Bladeturn
III</I> on the prone Fineas to protect him from further attacks while the elf
dragged himself away from the carnage. Mystical used <I>Hurling</I> to
unbalance the demon while Meilu swept its legs from under it, toppling it
backwards into the spherical chamber.
<BR>&nbsp; Zem's <I>Gasvision</I> spell was still active, and he watched as
the Undead Glabrezou righted itself and begin crawling up the spherical wall.
Unfurling its wings, the demon gave a mighty flap to land on the rim of the
chamber. It landed in the middle of the can of whoop-ass as Kurik hit with
his battleaxe, Zem's <I>Death Strike</I> inflicted another critical of Slaying,
and Meilu's sweep toppled it to the ground.
<BR>&nbsp; The party chopped the zombie to pieces, none large enough to
threaten them again. On one of its fingers Kurik discovered a ring. When
removed, the body became fully visible. This was how the demon had remained
unseen during the battle. Unfortunately the ring carried a curse of
enslavement of some sort, and none dared put it on.
<BR>&nbsp; Haer had remained in the demon's lair amongst the offal. He
possessed no <I>Teleport</I> spell, and no-one had thought to cast it on
him. During the battle he had continued the search for treasure, finding a
green stone bust of an unidentified human and a small amount of loot before
the rest of the party rejoined him.

<BR>&nbsp; I held my nose while somebody else opened the trap door in the
floor of the demons lair. We crept down the tunnel, the halfling checking
for traps while the rest of us watched for ambush. It opened up into a
square chamber, where there were twelve humanoid bodies. Their armor and
equipment were that of an adventuring party.
<BR>&nbsp; I knew they were undead. How could it be otherwise? Every
damn thing in the place becomes Undead when it dies. I for one am
getting really sick of fighting Undead. I guess everybody else is too,
because Zem and Kurik cast <I>Holy Aura</I> and just stood there in the
doorway until the closest six had spontaneously combusted. I cast
<I>Telekineses</I> to drag the other six closer. Once all twelve had
turned to dust we used <I>Telekineses</I> again to drag out any
equipment still in good shape. There was a two handed sword which
carried a minor enchantment, and some loot. <I>[Editor's note: the sword
is +10]</I>
<BR>&nbsp; We never did enter the room. It was just some sort of trap that
killed a prior adventuring party. They probably <I>Gated</I> in anyway:
serves them right for messing with forces of which they have no
comprehension.

<U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; By this point the constant jabbering of the Dretch had grown
quite annoying. Endira stopped her <I>Charming Song,</I> and Rosvenir
instead cast <I>Voice of Dominion.</I> His first command was for the bloody
creature to shut up. The party inexplicably began referring to the Dretch as
the Demonic Telemetry Probe (D. T. P. for short).
<BR>&nbsp; Meilu thoroughly checked the square room using
<I>Stonesight,</I> finding no secret doors or other hidden chambers. The
adventurers retraced their steps, teleported back through the silvery
mist, and descended through the hole in the floor which Fineas had <A
HREF="../h14/index.html#unstone">created</A>. This secret tunnel emerged
into a hallway at a &quot;T&quot; intersection. To the left the hall
ended in a false door concealing some sort of trap. To the right it ran
some thirty feet and then turned left.
<BR><A NAME="medusa">&nbsp;</A> Straight ahead the hallway ended in a door.
Meilu examined the room beyond using <I>Stonesight.</I> It was a rectangular
chamber with four low stone columns spaced evenly in the center. Braziers of
coals cast a dim reddish light. In the far wall was an alcove holding a
highly detailed statue of a robed human. The statue held one hand before
its eyes, as if shielding from something. It very much resembled a human
mage trying desperately not to look at a medusa.
<BR>&nbsp; Seeing no reason to face the gorgon, the party turned right and
followed the hallway around to the left. It opened into two parallel halls
which met at the far end, where a third hall doubled back upon the first
two. <I>[Editor's note: see the map inset]</I> Meilu's <I>Stonesight</I>
found a tunnel leading from a concealed door in the floor of the
intersection.
<BR>&nbsp; At the end of the center hallway was a four armed stone
gargoyle, looking very much like one found in the Tomb of Horrors. In
front of the statue was a cracked clay pot, the whole coated with a thin
layer of dust.

<P><U>Kurik's report to the Church</U>
<BR>&nbsp; I approached the stone gargoyle cautiously. It was almost
identical to one we had encountered in the original tomb, which seems an
eternity but was really only two weeks ago. There were a few differences,
though. This statue wore a leather collar studded with four black stones
about its neck, and was whole and undamaged unlike the one in the Tomb
which had an arm broken off.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT><A NAME="gargoyle">&nbsp;</A> Fineas suspected that the
gargoyle would at some point come to life and attack. He welded its feet to
the floor using a <I>Merge Stone</I> spell. In the original Tomb we placed a
gem in each of the remaining three hands, and as it crushed them the statue
released a ring from a hidden compartment. I got four gems from Haer to place
in the hands of the statue. Nothing happened. Haer then gave me four gems of
real value to try, though these had no more effect. I can only imagine how the
halfling would have reacted had they been crushed. Since the earlier gargoyle
had given us a ring, I had Haer dust the statue with flour and then placed the
ring of <I>Invisibility</I> on one of its hands. The statue faded from sight,
but remained unmoving. We placed more magic rings on its other fingers, to no
avail. I had to <I>Neutralize Curse</I> again to remove the ring from its
finger.

436 INT -- HALLWAY IN FORTRESS OF CONCLUSION -- INDETERMINATE TIME
  A stony guardian stoicly defends a clay pot at the end of the hall. The
  torchlight casts stark shadows across its face. [[Note to director: turn
  those damn arc lights down for this shot!!]]

  Pull back to see the little demon creeping toward the stone gargoyle.
  [[Casting: try to get Gilbert Gottfried, or somebody else with no pride.]]
  The demon climbs up to its chest, and nervously unbuckles the leather collar.
  As soon as the collar is loose the gargoyle springs to life, throttling the
  demon.

       Dretch:
  Argh! Gggack! Phptt!

  [[Note: we haven't given the Dretch any actual lines, so it doesn't qualify
  for speaking part residuals.]]

  Mystical is prepared, and teleports the demonling to safety.

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The Dretch managed to fling the leather collar behind the
flailing gargoyle, where it could be retrieved using <I>Telekineses.</I>
Haer discovered a hidden compartment in one of the black stones, in which
was a slip of paper. It read, &quot;Ahead the lines of access squarely meet,
the path to glory is at your feet. --A.&quot; This presumably referred to the
tunnel under the floor which Meilu had seen. Behind them the awakened
gargoyle continued to claw ineffectually at the air, and seemed quite
perturbed that it couldn't free its feet. Fineas cast <I>Unstone,</I>
turning it instantly to dust.
<BR>&nbsp; <A NAME="blacktile">Cautiously</A> the trap door was opened, and
the party followed a wide tunnel through several turns to emerge in a large
chamber tiled with one foot square black stones. There was an archway in one
wall, filled with a rolling orange haze. Similar to those in the original
Tomb, there were distinctive stones at the base of each side of the arch and
a third at the top. The stone on the left side of the archway was of jade, on
the right a pearlescent hue, while the stone on top was colored hazel. All
three stones began to glow softly as the party entered.
<BR>&nbsp; In the original Tomb, such stones had to be pushed in a
particular order to successfully traverse an archway. Having no idea of the
proper order, the party determined to make camp for the night and use magic
to learn the way. Meilu swept the area with <I>Stonesight.</I> The
wall opposite the archway bordered a large room tiled with green stone, each
bearing a letter or number. This green room was immediately beyond the
massive pit of Undead bones which the party had managed to avoid. Rosvenir
cast <I>Commune True</I> to learn the order to push the stones. The
answer was surprising: &quot;Order is irrelevant.&quot;
<P>&nbsp; Rosvenir cast <I>Dream IV</I> to know of four things:

<UL>
	<LI>To where does the archway lead?
	<LI>How do we get through the archway safely?
	<LI>Does the room with the <A HREF="#medusa">statue</A> have anything
		we need to complete our quest?
	<LI>Does the room of green tiles have anything we need to complete
		our quest?
</UL>

<P><U>Rosvenir's Dream</U>
<BR><I>Standing in a room with black tiles... Walk through the archway... It
diverges into two paths... In the first path, the three stones around the
arch are not glowing... This path leads to a brilliant blue light... The
stones are glowing at the beginning of the second path... This path diverges
again, with one branch leading to the green tiled room and the other to the
room with the statue... Both rooms are completely empty...</I>

<P><U>Day 30</U>
<BR>&nbsp; When Desatysso was released from his life of pain, his <A
HREF="../h14/index.html#zemcurse">curse</A> had transferred to Zem. Kurik
had neutralized the curse, but only for 22 hours. He had attempted to extend
the neutralization when the party made camp, but failed. Zem
lay now on the ground, his limbs bound tightly to his sides and his eyes and
mouth sewn closed. Kurik said a brief litany to Pandeos and attempted to
<I>Neutralize Curse</I> again, this time a more powerful spell which would
hold it at bay for weeks. It took three tries, but finally the spell took and
Zem was free.
<BR>&nbsp; The <I>Dream</I> indicated that the stones must be extinguished
before traversing the archway. Haer experimentally pushed the jade stone,
finding that it slid slightly inwards and then ceased to glow. He pushed the
pearl on the other side, and Rosvenir the top hazel stone. When all three
had been pushed the orange mist dissipated, leaving only a slight distortion
in the air where it had been. The room beyond was tiled with blue stones,
and held another arch in the far wall. This far arch appeared totally
mundane, with no mists or glowing stones.
<BR><A NAME="odie">&nbsp;</A> Rosvenir sent the Demonic Telemetry Probe
through the portal. The Dretch hesitated, then stepped through. A moment later
it appeared in the blue room, indicating that there is some sort of magical
transport involved. Suddenly something snatched the Dretch and dragged it out
of the field of view. Moments later the decapitated head of the poor demonling
bounced across the floor and came to rest staring at the adventurers, a pool
of greenish blood slowly forming beneath it. A few minutes later the
reanimated body of the Dretch shambled over, feeling about until finding its
head, and crookedly reattached it. The zombie Dretch staggered out of view.
