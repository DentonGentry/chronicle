<H1>A Turning of the Tide</H1>

<P>&nbsp; The Final Battle was not going well for the Horde of Darkness. The
battalions of orcs, so formidable at dawn, had been turned into just so much
meat by midday. The serpentine naga suffered greatly in the afternoon sun,
their body temperature raised and reactions slowed they were easily cut to
shreds by onrushing Paladins. The Fire Giants had done a great deal of
damage with their hurled exploding boulders until an enemy flight of pegasi
had wiped out the sorcerers maintaining their magical defences, leaving them
vulnerable to ice bolts shot by Good mages. The line of trolls was still
holding, though it took an entire company of goblins running around to
gather up the hacked off arms and legs for reattachment. As the Horde had
dwindled the Necromancers had done their best, but it takes time for an
undead to come into their own and a freshly raised minion of the Horde isn't
even close to a match for a liveried Warrior of the Light in full battle
regalia.

<P>&nbsp; The Forces of Evil seemed to take it all in stride. They had,
after all, lost in each of the previous twenty Final Battles, spaced
every thirty years or so. Deep down his revenance the Infernal General knew
that this battle would likely be no different. His main goal at this point
being population control for the Orcs, he hadn't even bothered to array his
forces in the most effective formation, instead maneuvering the Orc brigade
directly into the path of the oncoming Cavalry of Virtue.

<P>&nbsp; What neither the Infernal General nor his opposite the Anointed
One realized was that this time, for this battle, the balance had changed.
The mighty Orcus, long disinterested in this backwater parallel Prime, had
finally grown weary of the constant stream of requests and appeals for
demonic support from the Infernal General. Of course, Orcus had not sent his
prized Balor to help in this great battle, for they were needed elsewhere.
Likewise the Marilith, Nalfeshnee, Glabrezu, Hezrou, and Vrock had important
duties elsewhere tending to various machinations as the Dread Lord Orcus
explained in his message and was sure his minion on this plane would
understand. The Infernal General did not, in fact, understand. That is, he
did not understand until he saw the troops his Lord Orcus had seen fit to
send: cambions. Half demons. Scorned by all true demons, objects of
derision, sent to assist in this glorious conquest to come... The Lord Orcus
was mocking him.

<P><HR><P>

<P>&nbsp; Mystical hadn't understood either, at least not at first. Her
existence, some 20 years thus far, had been a dreadful one. Half-demons
occupy the lowest rung of the hierarchy of the Abyss, harassed and tormented
for fun and sport. She expected the wraith which had approached the cave she
and two other cambions shared to be seeking amusement at their expense.
Instead, it delivered a message. They were told to report to the Palace of
Bone at once. There the three were met by a spectre, a minor functionary in
the administration of Orcus, who ordered them to report to the Infernal
General on a Prime Material plane and opened a gateway to send
them.

<P>&nbsp; Upon their arrival the General had continued looking over their
shoulders at the closing gate, obviously expecting more reinforcements.
Seeing none, he took the letter Mystical handed him, which contained a
message she herself had not read. The General spent a long few minutes
reading that message. When finished, his great shoulders slumped slightly,
and he crushed it in one taloned hand. Spinning on a heel the General left
them. He had not said a word.

<P>&nbsp; That had been two days ago. Lacking any direction of where to
report, the other two cambions had linked up with a unit of ogres where the
minotaur captain agreed to accept them into his command. Mystical, finally
realizing that Orcus had ordered them here to die merely to insult the
Infernal General, vowed not to give in. Stealing away from the encamped
Horde that night she snuck into the woods, travelling many miles until
she reached the furthest perimeter of the Forces of Light.

<P>&nbsp; Now wearing the uniform she had stolen that night, Mystical moved
freely amongst the ranks of the righteous. Her magical healing abilities,
long the object of scorn and derision in the Abyss, now reinforced
her persona as a battlefield priest. She tended to wounds major and minor
of the troops of Light, all the while making her way deeper and
deeper into their rear area.

<P>&nbsp; The Anointed One sat astride her horse at the crest of a hill,
her sharp eyes scanning the battlefield below. The pegasi had done a fine
job scattering the troublesome line of trolls on the left flank, and it
would be at least an hour before the trolls managed to regenerate themselves
back into a credible fighting force. By that time she expected the Horde to
be in full retreat back to their warrens in the Underdark.

<P>&nbsp; Mystical tended the injured in a large tent behind the crest of
the hill. One eye always on the Anointed One, she bided her time and
awaited her chance. That chance came sooner rather than later. A black robed
sorcerer, either far braver or far more stupid than most, flew in fast and
low from the front lines. Hands working furiously, the mage attempted to
loose a fireball onto the hilltop as he passed. The mage was, of course,
pincushioned with at least ten arrows before getting that close, but the
arrow strikes had an unintended effect: the spell was partially cast.
Lacking guidance the magical flames engulfed the sorcerer's body, and he
screamed as he plummeted towards the hilltop. His screams completed the
spell, which exploded point blank amongst the leaders of the forces of
Light.

<P>&nbsp; Mystical was the first to arrive at the scene. Being more
resistant to heat than mere mortals she pushed through the scorching flames
to the top of the hill.  Blood and gore of slaughtered horses lay strewn
across the ground. The Anointed One and her commanders were made of sterner
stuff, though they had not escaped without injury. The Anointed One lay
face down on the grass, bleeding from several wounds which were already
beginning to close. Of extra-planar heritage herself, the Anointed One was
certain to recover consciousness quickly. This gave Mystical only a few
seconds to act. Removing a small silver vial from her pouch, she quickly
unscrewed the stopper. She poured the contents of the vial into the
open wound in the Anointed One's torso. The wound, which had been rapidly
healing of its own accord, began to re-open. The substance was distilled
essence of mandrake, a powerful poison to demons and, as Mystical had now
confirmed, Devas as well. The potion had been given to Mystical by her
mother, a succubus of some prestige in the harem of Orcus. She had told her
favorite daughter to use it in time of direst need. Mystical cast spells of
healing to close the gaping wound, sealing the poison inside the unconscious
Deva.

<P>&nbsp; The flames had subsided sufficiently for others to push through
and come to the aid of their commander. Only a minor healer according to the
insignia of her uniform, Mystical was pushed aside as more senior clerics
crowded in. The injuries sustained by the Anointed One were serious and,
strangely, her otherworldly body did not seem to be mending itself as
quickly as it usually did. The healers began pouring energy into the angelic
body, closing wounds and mending broken bones. They did not realize until
too late that the real danger lay not in the physical wounds, but in the
chemical coursing through her veins. The Anointed One died without
regaining consciousness.

<P>&nbsp; By the time the word began to spread through the ranks of the
Righteous, Mystical was halfway back to the front. The devastating news
swept the forces of Good like a torrent. The paladins could not hold back
tears, dropping to their knees in agony. This suited the trolls just fine
who, limbs newly reattached, began to wade through the throng like an avenging
wind. The ogre magi, able at last to get spells past the defenses of the
demoralized wizards, revelled in the destruction of the human and demihuman
liveries. Mystical abandoned her disguise as she reached the battle front,
rejoining the Horde of Darkness just as it broke through the enemy lines.
The slaughter commenced.

<P><HR><P>

<P>&nbsp; The Great Feast had lasted for days. Unaccustomed to total
victory, the Horde of Darkness had perhaps overdone it a bit. They hadn't
left many of the snivelling surface dwellers alive to look forward to their
lives of slavery, hadn't separated the gold from the platinum ornaments
they looted from temples of good deities before melting it all down, and in
some cases hadn't even pillaged the villages before burning them. In short,
it had been one hell of a party.

<P>&nbsp; Mystical did not know what to expect upon her return to the Abyss.
She was, after all, not expected to return at all. One of the other two
cambions would not, having fallen early in the battle when the company
of ogres was beset by mountain dwarves. She expected to be punished
severely, perhaps even killed, for her insolence in surviving.

<P>&nbsp; She very nearly was. Niglisshibin, the spectre who had assigned
them the task of reporting to the Infernal General's legions, roughly
grabbed the other cambion as they stepped through the gate, draining away
his life force in a few seconds. Eyes glowing, Niglisshibin looked directly
at her. &quot;Report to Grazzharden, the weapons master.&quot; is all he
said, dropping the lifeless husk of the other half-demon as he did. Mystical
did not know it at the time but she was spared her fate by Elik, who had
taken notice of her actions on the Prime and marked her as one who bore
further interest. Elik is a Balor, and a chief lieutenant to Orcus. With a
few words in the proper ears he arranged for Mystical to receive training in
weapons, magic, and assassination techniques. She did not learn the identity
of her patron until much later.
