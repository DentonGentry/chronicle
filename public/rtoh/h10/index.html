<H2>Chapter 10: The Tangled Web We Weave</H2>
<H4>&quot;Moil (n) - 1. the Rabbi who performs the circumcision at a Bris.&quot;</H4>

he dragon roared its impotent rage as the party retreated down the bridge,
silver key in hand. This was the first of three items from <A
HREF="../h7/index.html#obelisk">Acerak's poem.</A> The group immediately set
out for the tower containing the riddle-box, the second item which
Rosvenir's <A HREF="../h9/index.html#dream"><I>Dream</I></A> spell had also
located. Reaching the riddle-box required retracing steps back through the
tower of the casino and down to its lower level, where a second bridge was
secured.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<IMG SRC="tower9.gif" ALT="Tower #9" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=217 WIDTH=242
	ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=3 VSPACE=1 USEMAP="#tower9">
<A NAME="satchel">&nbsp;</A> The upper level of the casino was exactly as it
was left, though the smoldering black fire of the destroyed
<A HREF="../h9/index.html#wight">Winter Wight</A> had finally extinguished.
The party descended to the lower level. The staircase terminated at a doorway,
beside which lay a satchel covered in frost. Zem poked carefully at it with
his broadsword, slicing the leather cleanly open. Inside was a large
collection of glass vials, mostly unmarked. The glue of the labels had
frozen, leaving a pile of paper slips at the bottom of the pouch. Only one
vial could be extracted with its label still attached, which read
&quot;Corpse Dust, Acerak.&quot; Obviously the satchel had been carried by
someone from the Prime Material Plane, presumably Desatysso. The remaining
vials contained various dried animal parts, and perhaps a few of human
origin as well, all apparently for use as spell components.
<BR>&nbsp; The door was not trapped. It opened onto a hallway with several
doors on either side. The group turned left and strode into a large room.
There were two bizarre humanoid metal constructs, one crumpled in a heap and
the other still standing. This one held a stone tablet with a partial
message which read, &quot;and by which token you are accounted guests in the
Tower of Chance.&quot; Obviously it was a continuation of a message begun on
the destroyed tablet of the first construct. The party did not let this
trivial mystery distract them, and left the Tower of Chance.
<BR>&nbsp; From the outside the next tower looked the same as many of the
others in Moil, constructed of a mixture of stone and metal. Over the lintel
were embedded several gold and platinum pieces: the party had finally found
the Treasury! To their dismay the inside of the tower was completely
hollow, not even a bridge leading across to the opposite archway. The
Moilian treasury, with what surely had been a vast collection of wealth, was
irrevocably gone. The adventurers cast various magics allowing flight and
crossed to the other side.

<P><A NAME="spiders">&nbsp;</A> A short span led to the next tower, which also
appeared to be empty at first. Peering inside revealed a greenish glow
emanating from below. An extensive web made of what looked like emerald was
spun across the width of the tower. The web glowed with a sickly green light,
casting eerie shadows across the walls. Strands of the web were secreted to
the wall of the tower at numerous places about its circumference,
approximately level with the entrance. The whole mass sloped downwards until
at its center the web was nearly fifty feet below its zenith.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<A HREF="pov.html"><IMG SRC="spider.jpg" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="262"
	BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=3 VSPACE=1></A>
&nbsp; Rosvenir's <I>Presence</I> spell detected fourteen minds. They
were spread out throughout the web, with the deepest being more than one
hundred feet down. A <I>Mind Typing</I> on that one identified it as another
Winter Wight. The rest were some sort of arachnid. A bit of rubble dredged
from the depths of the Bag of Holding and thrown into the center of the web
drew several of the spiders out. They were enormous, nearly four feet
across, with scarlet eyes completely encircling their head. Their whole
body was somewhat insubstantial, fading to nothingness in the legs. Endira
identified them as a Wraith Spider, a form of Undead arachnid.

<BR>&nbsp; One of the spiders which emerged was quickly dispatched by a
spell from Mystical. The rest of the party cast various magics to prepare
for battle. Feeling confident, Kurik cast <I>Fly</I> and maneuvered out to
the exact center of the web. Touching down, he prepared to draw the spiders
out. Of course, the moment he touched the web he was affected by its magic
and paralyzed. Twelve spiders scurried forth, planning to make a meal of the
paladin.

<P><U>Mystical</U>
<BR>&nbsp; I'm not sure but I think Kurik was dumbstruck by the size or
speed of the spiders dashing towards him, or maybe it was something about
the web. Anyhow, he just wasn't moving. My <I>Firebolt</I> and Rosvenir's
<I>Starbolt</I> fried two of them. At the time it didn't appear that more
conventional weaponry was hurting these creatures. There were just too many
of them, and they washed over Kurik. Rosvenir took to the air, which seemed
like a good idea so we could get a closer shot, so Zem and I followed. Still
they clustered around Kurik, biting him with their mandibles. In desperation
Rosvenir activated the <A HREF="../h8/index.html#wand">Wand of Days</A>. The
chamber lit up bright as day. And nothing happened. Nothing at all, the Wand
didn't phase the spiders in the slightest.
<BR>&nbsp; With Kurik in the mix we had to call our shots carefully. 
I hit a couple of them with <I>Firebolts,</I> while Zem flew low
and hacked with his broadsword. Rosvenir distracted about five of them
away from Kurik, and then peppered those five with <I>Starbolts.</I>
They couldn't take damage as well as they could dish it out, and quickly
turned into crispy critters.

<P><A NAME="wight"><U>The Narrator</U></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Two spiders managed to bite Zem. He felt extreme cold from the
wound, the opposite of Kurik (who suffered burn damage). Soon enough Kurik's
paralysis wore off, and he flew upwards out of range. Mystical then began
throwing <I>Fireballs</I> at the creatures, while Zem and Rosvenir sent
additional bolts of energy at them until only six badly damaged arachnids
remained. Those six dove for cover in the web.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<A HREF="pov.html"><IMG SRC="wight.jpg" WIDTH="480" HEIGHT="360"
	BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=3 VSPACE=1></A>
&nbsp; Mystical flew down close and began to hack away at the web itself.
This enraged the remaining spiders, which flew from their hiding places and
managed to bite her severely. The party killed one of them with a volley of
missile weapons, and the rest retreated. After healing his wounds Kurik flew
back to the web to begin hacking at the hole Mystical had started. The five
remaining spiders crept in close, but did not attack. One spider lost its
footing and tried to stabilize itself with two of its legs. Unfortunately it
chose the two legs which had been whacked off in the battle, and tumbled end
over end before impaling itself on Kurik's axe. Having had enough punishment
for one day, the remaining arachnids retreated deep into the strands and
were not seen again.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<A NAME="ring"></A>
<A HREF="pov.html"><IMG SRC="falling.jpg" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="300"
	BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=3 VSPACE=1></A>
&nbsp; Kurik cut his way down sixty, seventy, and finally eighty feet before
breaking through the bottom most layer of the emerald webbing. Zem, Mystical,
and Rosvenir joined him before passing through to the other side. Several
thick strands extended from the underside of the web to attach to a large box
nearly fifty feet below. Flying lower, the group spotted the Winter Wight
standing below the box. That is, it stood on the bottom side of the box as
though it didn't know the meaning of the word &quot;gravity.&quot; The Wight
straightened and began to walk, still upside down, through the air towards the
adventurers. Rosvenir spotted a golden ring on the Wight's finger. Focussing
his concentration, he managed to cast <I>Long Door Item</I> to teleport the
ring into his own pocket. The ring was later identified as a Ring of Universal
Movement, and the lack of it caused the Wight to suddenly learn the definition
of gravity. It also got to learn the meaning of &quot;velocity&quot; before
plunging into the mists below.

<P>&nbsp; The riddle box was nearly ten feet on a side, and painted with
red symbols. It did not sound hollow when rapped on, and the thick webs
securing it implied it was quite heavy. There was an inscription in the
Common tongue on the bottom of the box:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Many tails have I, or, many a beginning. If I fail people
sigh, wails mark their passing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Beneath the riddle were three plaques, each engraved with a picture:
<UL>
	<LI>a mighty oak tree with many roots reaching into loamy soil
	<LI>a cat with numerous hissing, snake-headed tails.
	<LI>a rope, one end frayed and partially unravelled.
</UL>
Discussing the choices at some length, eventually the third plaque was
chosen. The rope image disappeared from the button when pushed, but there
was no other effect.

<BR>&nbsp; The party left the tower of the spiders, and returned to the
lower level of the Tower of Chance. Choosing a small room beside the
staircase, Mystical fortified the window and doors with a <I>Wall of
Stone</I> and the group got a few hours of much-needed sleep. Rosvenir cast
<I>Dream</I> to know of four things:
<OL>
	<LI>How did pushing the rope button help us?
	<LI>Where is the Phantom?
	<LI>Where is the Sand of Time?
	<LI>What is the Darkweaver's weakness?
</OL>

<P><A NAME="dream"><U>Rosvenir's Dream</U></A>
<BR><I>&nbsp; A creature... unlike anything I've seen. It is the only one of
its kind. Its huge, and somehow squished into a room too small to encompass
it. Huge wings folded up along its sides... protubances on the front (arms?)
are chained to the walls with golden manacles.
<BR>&nbsp; The vision pulls back down a hallway barred with three portcullises
in red, blue, and green. The red bars flow and form into the shape of a rope,
then dissipate.
<BR>&nbsp; The vision continues to pull back until it is outside in the mist.
The tower is not cylindrical, but rectangular. The tower dissolves into dust
which rebuilds itself into a cylindrical tower with rings around its girth and
a single bridge leading to it, an off-center spike gracing its top.
<BR>&nbsp; The vision backs away and into darkness. The sound of scurrying feet
is all around. I can't see. I must see. Fumbling to light the torch, flint
striking against steel. The shuffling feet scurry away at the sound.</I>
