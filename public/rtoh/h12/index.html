ystical's <I>Intangible Object</I> spell was quite effective, turning a full
four foot radius of the tower wall into a hazy, insubstantial substance
behind which was... more stone. The wall was quite thick in this area.
Strangely, the strands of Darkness were present even within the stone of the
wall, requiring an <I>Utterlight</I> spell to blast away. Another
<I>Intangible Object</I> at the farthest radius of the first revealed more
stone, with more strands to be blasted away. Finally, after several more
such spells and a great deal of patience a small hole was opened all the way
through to the other side. It was not large enough to crawl through, but
sufficient to see what lay beyond.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P><U>Rosvenir</U>
<BR>&nbsp; There were more of the solid threads of Darkness on the other
side. I cast <I>Utterlight</I> immediately, and thats when I caught a glimpse
of it: some form of giant arachnid, of the genus <I>salticus</I> if I am not
mistaken though a better look at its mandibles could confirm it. Its legs
were not clearly visible due to the enormous bulk of its body. Two long
tentacles sprouted from afore, and some sort of scorpion-like tail from
atop. The creature moved rapidly away, accompanied by a dry scraping sound
like leaves on stone. A low muttering could be heard, not so much physically
as mentally. This may indicate a potential for Mentalism magic in the
creature.
<BR>&nbsp; Mystical created a <I>Wall of Fire</I> in the center of the room,
to burn away more of the webbing and throw enough light to see. The room was
circular, and quick examination showed we had chosen badly in the location
for our insubstantial tunnel. The wall was much thinner only a few feet down
the hallway. As the spells had only a short duration remaining we moved down
the hall and created an opening at the new location. I cast <I>Presence</I>
to track the location of the Darkweaver. Fascinating creature, I shall have
to try to get a sample to study.

<P><A NAME="wand"><U>The Narrator</U></A>
<BR>&nbsp; Renewing defensive magics, the adventurers charged through the
second hole and into the chamber beyond. The webbing recently burned away by
Rosvenir's <I>Utterlight</I> was slowly regenerating, once again
obscuring the corners of the room. According to the <I>Presence</I> spell
the Darkweaver had remained stationary near the back of the room until the
party charged through. Then suddenly she was in the hallway they had just
left. The Darkweaver could teleport.
<P>&nbsp; Rushing back through the insubstantial hole to the hallway, Zem
crept towards the webbing where Rosvenir detected the Darkweaver but could
not see the creature. His <I>Holy Aura</I> must have damaged her, because
she rushed forward to strike a glancing blow against his arm. Incredibly,
the weaver remained invisible during the attack. Nonetheless by attacking
Zem she had revealed her location to the rest of the party. Rosvenir
activated the <A HREF="../items/index.html#wanddays">Wand of Days</A>, which
blasted away the webs of Darkness surrounding Zem. Simultaneously, Endira
began chanting a <I>Holding Song,</I> drastically slowing the movements of
the arachnid. Haer threw a <A HREF="../items/index.html#potions">potion of
utterlight</A> which splashed the Weaver, burning one tentacle and finally
making her visible. Zem's sword struck deep, his opponent unable to move
quickly enough to defend, and the <I>Lightning Blade</I> arced across her
body. Then the Darkweaver teleported away.

<P><U>Kurik's report to the Church</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Since the time we entered Moil, though my dispatches have
disappeared from the tithing bag I know not whether they reach the Temple. I
have begun writing copies in the event they do not, and shall deliver them
in person should I survive this place.
<BR>&nbsp; The Darkweaver had teleported to a remote area of the tower. We
crept back through the insubstantial hole to the central chamber, in hope
that some clue as to her vulnerabilities could be found. The halfling noted
it first: something metallic in the ceiling directly above the raging
<I>Wall of Fire.</I> Mystical obligingly removed the flame, and we could see
it clearly: a lever. An inscription in Common next to it read,
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is the mechanism you seek. Permanent activation will not
only achieve one of your goals, but also set in <U>motion</U> events of
great <U>magnitude</U>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; The lever sat at one end of its channel, which was marked with a
minus sign. The other end of its channel was marked with a plus. I reached
up and threw the lever, and it settled into place with a solid click. The
plus sign lit up, and several seconds later the floor began to rumble and
buck.
<BR>&nbsp; We ran madly for the exit.

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Everyone charged out of the central chamber and back down the
hallway. Rosvenir managed to maintain his concentration on the
<I>Presence</I> spell, and yelled that the Darkweaver had teleported around
the corner ahead of them. Mystical reached the corner first, and cast a
<I>Fireball</I> down its length before ducking back. The spell exploded on
contact with the webs of Darkness, burning away twenty feet of the stuff and
singeing the Darkweaver within. Endira cast another <I>Holding Song</I> to
slow the arachnids movements.
<BR>&nbsp; The Weaver backed into the intact webbing, and cast a powerful
<I>Sleep</I> spell which affected Rosvenir and Endira. Mystical threw
another <I>Fireball</I> down the hallway. Zem charged forth even as it
smoldered to slash at the Weaver, scoring several deep hits before she
teleported away bleeding heavily.


<P><U>Kahlen's Journal</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The shaking of the tower was becoming much worse. Walking was
impossible, and we had to resort to <I>Fly</I> spells. I flew over to cast
<I>Awaken</I> on Rosvenir, as Endira had managed to shake off the effects of
the Darkweaver's <I>Sleep</I> spell on her own.
<BR>&nbsp; With everyone able to move again, we made for the exit. 
<BR>&nbsp; The Darkweaver did not give up so easily. Wounded but not
defeated, she lay in wait somewhere in the webs of Darkness. Rosvenir had lost
the <I>Presence</I> spell when affected by <I>Sleep,</I> and was now too busy
blasting away the webs of Darkness with <I>Utterlight</I> to cast it again.
We did not know where the Weaver was.
<BR>&nbsp; This was a terrible mistake. The Darkweaver attacked when only a
small amount of the Darkness separated us from the exit. Mystical stood
facing the tower entrance, her back to the webs behind her. Suddenly six
tentacles extended forth and lashed about her, stinging her severely and
pulling her backwards. It all happened in the blink of an eye. Kurik rushed
forward to help, his <I>Holy Aura</I> inflicting damage even as he ran. Haer
hit one of the tentacles with a sling bullet, loosening its grip though the
other five held fast. Zem slashed at another tentacle just before the
Darkweaver teleported away, dragging Mystical with her through the ether.


<P><PRE><U>Conversation at the Gaming Table</U>
GM: You take 6 'E' Heat criticals, and 6 'D' Void crits.
Mystical: &lt;Gulp!&gt; Good thing I cast <I>Toughness</I> before the battle.
GM: The first hit inflicts 15 hp, and an 'E' heat critical which your
	<I>Toughness</I> spell reduces to a 'D'. You take 3 more hits, two
	rounds of stun, and you're at -10. You also take a 'D' Void critical
	which gets reduced to a 'C'. Thats another 6 hits, another round of
	stun, you lose 6 power points, and you're at another -10.
Mystical: Ouch.
GM: The next tentacle hits you for 19 points. You take another 'E' critical,
	12 more hits and 3 rounds of stun.
Mystical: Don't forget the toughness.
GM: Oh yeah. Make the critical 8 hits and one round of stun instead. You take
	another 'D' Void crit which is actually a 'C', three more hits.
<P><I>some time later...</I>
GM: tentacle number 4... 21 hits, 4 rounds of stun.
Mystical: <I>(sarcastically)</I> thats <U>only</U> 12 rounds so far.
GM: The 'E' heat critical gets reduced to a 'D' (nice choice on the spell,
	by the way). 6 more hits, another round of stun. The 'D' Void is
	actually a 'C', 9 more hits and another round of stun.
<P><I>still later...</I>
GM: tentacle number 6, last tentacle... 22 hits, 1 round of stun.
	That <I>Toughness</I> spell is gonna save your butt. 5 more hits
	from the heat crit, and 8 more from the Void. Whats the total?
Mystical: 165 hits, 15 rounds of stun, 17 power points, and I lost track of
	the maneuver penalty but its huge.
</PRE>


<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; The Darkweaver had fled to the furthest depths of the tower to
feed. This was probably not the best plan. Having only one hit point left,
and bleeding 10 hits per round, the Weaver died immediately after
teleporting. Healing magic might have been a better idea than grabbing a
snack. Mystical found herself in a small chamber, badly injured and stunned.
There was a statue of a robed man, his long beard flowing down to his belt
in an alcove before her. The hands of the statue were cupped out before him,
and twin pinpricks of light shone from the eyes. There was a copper plate on
the base of the statue, with lettering in the demonic language of Moil. Her
vision blurred from the trauma, and unfamiliar with the Moilian dialect,
Mystical could make out only a few words: &quot;thirst,&quot;
&quot;reward,&quot; and &quot;great.&quot;

<P>&nbsp; Rosvenir cast two <I>Utterlight</I> spells in quick succession,
destroying all remaining webbing between the party and the exit. While
heading to the door he cast <I>Finding</I> to determine Mystical's location.
The party rushed out onto the bridge.

<P>&nbsp; Mystical attempted to cast <I>Intangible Form</I> on herself,
planning to walk straight through the walls of the tower to safety, but in her
weakened state fumbled the spell. Recovering quickly, she tried again
and succeeded. Having no idea where she was, she picked
a direction and began to walk.

<P><A NAME="room">&nbsp;</A> The party moved away from the tower, guiding
Rosvenir as he cast one final spell. The tower was visibly swaying back and
forth, with large cracks appearing in the walls. Rosvenir completed the
<I>Mind's Door</I> spell even as the stone began to crumble, teleporting
Mystical to the bridge in front of him. The tower fell to the mists below in
pieces, tearing away the section of the bridge closest to it. The
adventurers ran across the remaining bridge to the Tower of Health.

<P>&nbsp; The group claimed an empty room and sealed the entrance for the
night. Kahlen healed most of the damage done to Mystical, and let her sleep
off the rest. Rosvenir cast <I>Dream IV,</I> to know of these things:
<OL>
	<LI>Who is Acerak's <A HREF="../h3/index.html#journal">Tenebrous</A> mentor?
	<LI>What is the Vestige that guards the Sands of Time?
	<LI>How can the Wand of Days be safely recharged in Moil?
	<LI>What is the most useful magic item in Moil?
</OL>
<I>[Editor's note: as should be obvious, the players could come up with only
three good questions. Not wanting to let the fourth go to waste, Rosvenir
tried to dream for a gimme.]</I>


<P><A NAME="dream"><U>Rosvenir's Dream</U></A>
<BR><I>&nbsp; in one of the towers of Moil... not sure which one... it is
completely empty... instead of the central support column, there is an
hourglass filled with sand... the sand becomes translucent until it looks
like a mist... there are murmurs now, mentally heard... the mist grows
denser, pushing at the hourglass until it breaks out into the room... it
almost fills the chamber, but then recoils back into a small ball...
<BR>&nbsp; As the mist withdraws, the room is changed... now just a bare
stone room... the last of the mist covers something written on the floor...
the mist shrinks and blows away, the writing is a name: Tarnhem... there is
power in that name... the power grows, and begins to glow... the glow
becomes painfully bright and menacing... there is much power there... cover
the eyes, trying not to be blinded by it... look again, the room has
changed... in the center is the stand for the Wand of Days... it is empty,
but is glowing with power... it requires something to release the
power...</I>
