The answer is: they didn't. * The boulder in the gaming session was just a regular * rock. The image was made to look like a boulder * trap from Dungeon Keeper, an incredibly cool game that * a number of the players are addicted to. Dungeon Keeper * is distributed by Electronic Arts and written by * Bullfrog Co, http://www.bullfrog.co.uk/) * * Scale is 1 POVunit == 1 foot. * * Created 5/16/99 by Denton Gentry. */global_settings {	assumed_gamma 1.8	ambient_light rgb<1, 1, 1>}// Texture by Chuck Fusner, http://www.enter.net/~cfusner#local RoughStone = texture { //rough stone texture...	pigment { //nice and random on the pigment.		granite		color_map {		[ 0 rgb .5 ]		[ .25 rgb .65 ]		[ .5 rgb .5 ]		[ .75 rgb .7 ]		[ 1 rgb .5 ]		}		frequency 100	}	normal { /*love that crackle!
