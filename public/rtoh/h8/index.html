allying only briefly in the extreme cold, the group picked a tower and
headed for it. The bridge led through an archway, where a catwalk ran from
the entrance to a circular platform at the center of the hollow structure.
Three smaller platforms were spaced at even intervals around the central,
with stairs leading to them. Upon each of these smaller platforms was a tall
metallic arch.
<BR>&nbsp; Stepping carefully down the stairs to the first platform (the
upper right one on the map), Zem stood before the archway. Made of a silvery
metal and filled with a grey mist, to one side was a circular panel
which held three palm-shaped depressions. The first was colored blue, the
second black, and the third red. Three symbols were inscribed above the
arch, one each in blue, black and red. Zem thought the archways resembled
teleportation gateways similar to ones used in the Kaydian homeland.
Placing his hand in the blue depression caused it to glow softly with blue
light. New symbols appeared on top of the arch in a blue script. They were
similar to a demonic language Mystical knew, and said &quot;Tower of
Health&quot;. A hand placed in the black depression caused it to glow softly
and the blue to fade out. The words atop the archway were replaced with
different symbols which Mystical read as &quot;Hub&quot; The red control
caused &quot;Periphery&quot; to appear.
<BR>&nbsp; The second platform (the bottom one on the map) held a similar
archway filled with grey haze. The word &quot;Kainrath&quot; was written in
demonic script above the archway. Mystical remembered that Kainrath was
another city which had worshipped Orcus, but couldn't recall anything else
about it. The final platform held an arch filled with yellowish haze. A
control panel with a single yellow palm print stood to one side. There was
no symbol carved above the arch, and though the palm print began to glow a
soft yellow when Rosvenir touched it, no lettering appeared.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>&nbsp;

<BR><U>Mystical</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Orcus had really screwed these people. He'd removed Moil to a
demi-plane, which is a small bubble universe hidden inside some other plane
of existence. The funny thing about demi-planes is that its impossible to
keep the borders sealed. Some amount of mixing takes place, and if you can
find the boundary you can push through to whatever is on the other side.
<BR>&nbsp; I decided to test a theory. I cast a <I>Fireball</I> downwards
towards the mist at the bottom of the tower. I got a good look at the walls
as it went down: they are smooth, with no platforms below this one. The ball
travelled about four hundred feet before it entered the mists, and a second
later it just winked out. It didn't detonate, so it didn't hit anything. It
must have passed through the border and into whatever plane the Fat Bastard
moved Moil to. Knowing him, its probably the Elemental Plane of Fire. He'd
enjoy the irony of a frozen city surrounded by True Flame.

<P><U>The Narrator</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Not wishing to try their luck at Portal travel, the party left
the tower. There was some lettering above the archway, and after clearing
the ice it could be clearly read in the same demonic script: &quot;Tower of
Portals&quot;.
<BR>&nbsp; Crossing the causeway to the next tower, someone had the bright
idea to knock the ice from the lettering above the archway before entering.
The moment the ice was cleared from the sunset pattern carved in the stone
everyone had to make an RR versus 100th level Arcane magic. Amazingly,
Mystical and Rosvenir both made it. Everyone else succumbed and fell into a
deep, unwakeable slumber. Pulling people away from the edges of the bridge,
the two attempted everything they could think of to wake the rest. Nothing
worked. Fortunately Kahlen's <I>Awake</I> spell was cast unconsciously, and
she sat up of her own accord.
<BR>&nbsp; Dragging the sleeping party members into the tower, Mystical
created a <I>Wall of Stone</I> to block the entrance and built a small fire
to keep them from freezing to death. Kahlen repeatedly cast
<I>Awakening,</I> allowing additional RRs until Kurik, Zem, and Endira had
shaken off the effects of the spell. Only Haergronagin remained asleep.

<P><U>Haer's dream sequence</U>
<TABLE COLUMNS="1">
<TR><TD><I>bounding through the fields of the Shire, not a care in the
world, the prarie meadows blooming on a warm spring day. His mother's voice
calls out: &quot;Haer, you must come back now, we need you to wake up!&quot;
The young halfling doesn't want to leave, and runs faster.</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&quot;What do ye think you're doing, coming back 'ere with this
measly take? A blind dwarf with one 'and chopped off could've picked more
pockets than this!&quot;, said the Master thief, towering over the hobbit
standing before him. &quot;It was the best I could do, sir,&quot; said the
apprentice, &quot;the city guard keeps an eye on halflings in the market,
sir.&quot; The Master growled, &quot;If this be the best you can do ye'll
never pass the initiation into th' Guild of Thieves. Yer only recourse will
be to wake up.&quot;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><I>Don't look down, thats no good. Fifty foot drop would be the end
of me. One foot in front of the other, thats it. Just like the Guild
training hall, only now its real. Good. Pathetic lock on the window
shutters, just as expected. Oil the hinges, check for wires... none. Open
the shutters. Slip over the sill and into the wizard's bedroom. There he
lies, sleeping like a baby. Step once... twice... make no noise. Good. Pull
the packet of sleeping powder out of the belt pouch, make sure he has a
nice, deep slumber for the next few hours while I rob his house. YIKES! The
wizard sits straight up in bed. &quot;I think you had better wake up now,
Haer&quot;, said the Archmage Bigby.</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&quot;It looks about thirty feet down. Jobe, would you do the
honors?&quot; said the diminutive thief. Jobe focused his eyes on something
unseen down the hallway, and extended his arms to touch the corridor walls
on either side. Muscles in his arms tightened and exerted force on the
stone. More muscles in Jobe's chest and abdomen flexed, wedging him firmly in
place. Still more muscles in his back extended to their fullest, causing the
ancient mortar of the walls to creak in protest. Muscles that Haer didn't
even know existed flexed and bulged in Jobe's neck, rooting him to the spot.
Jobe was now, quite simply, immovable. Tying a rope about the warrior
monk's waist, Haer stood at the edge of the pit and prepared to descend.
&quot;Wait,&quot; said his companion, &quot;don't you think you should wake
up first?&quot;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT><U>Day 25</U>
<IMG SRC="tower2.gif" ALT="Tower #2" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=217 WIDTH=218
	ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=3 VSPACE=1 USEMAP="#tower2">
<BR>&nbsp; Kahlen had cast <I>Awakening</I> a total of seventy times, thirty
five on Haer before finally awakening him. Her magic was nearly spent, and
she needed rest to recover. Also it was positively balmy inside the cave
Mystical had created compared to the cold outside, encouraging sleep. The
party got some rest.
<BR>&nbsp; Eight hours later when Kahlen felt recovered Mystical dispelled
the walls of stone and exploration of the second tower began. Kurik cast
<I>Detect Enemies</I> and found two, at the locations marked with red
symbols on the map. Haer checked each door for traps, finding none. The
floors of the tower were covered in a layer of ice, and frost coated the
walls. Most of the rooms were completely empty, stripped bare by the
elements and the strange nature of the demi-plane. Only rooms which held
something of note will be described in this Chronicle.
<BR><A NAME="throneheal">&nbsp; The</A> first room entered (marked
&quot;A&quot; on the map) held a large, throne shaped chair heavily carved
with symbols and runes. An intricate sunrise was carved into the back, though
obscured by a thick layer of ice. The throne looked out upon Moil through a
ten foot opening in the outer wall of the tower, which had once been a glass
window. Rosvenir identified the signature of numerous spells enchanting the
throne, all of a restorative and rejuvinative nature (as of healing).
<BR>&nbsp; Continuing in counterclockwise direction, the party came to a
long hallway (marked &quot;B&quot; on the map) which was almost completely
choked with ice. Icy stalactites and stalagmites had formed and in some
places extended until they merged together into a thick column. Not liking
the idea of traversing a place where things could drop from above, Mystical
created a <I>Wall of Fire</I> and a <I>Wall of Ice</I> sculpted into a
trough to carry the melted water down the hallway and out the window of the
throne room. The ice melting slowly under the magical assault, the party
decided to return later.
<BR>&nbsp; Retracing their steps the group explored a number of empty rooms
before coming to a large room at the end of the outer hallway (marked
&quot;C&quot; on the map). Kurik's spell had detected an enemy in this room,
so Rosvenir cast <I>Merging</I> to get a look inside. It was a library,
with a number of empty bookshelves running floor to ceiling which unfortunately
blocked his view.

<A NAME="wight"><P></A>
<U>Kurik's report to the Church, delivered via Tithing Bag</U>
<BR>&nbsp; Rosvenir, Zem and I advanced slowly into the room towards the
spot which Pandeos had revealed. We found the enemy between two bookcases,
an undead creature frozen under a layer of ice on the floor. As we
approached the ice began to crack as the abomination broke itself free,
and the battle was joined.
<BR>&nbsp; The creature radiated intense cold, and could focus it into a
magical attack. I summoned the holy magics to <I>Repel</I> the undead, but
felt a powerful impediment to the spell and it had no effect. I prayed to
Pandeos to grant me the strength to Turn it. Mystical encased the creature
in a <I>Wall of Ice,</I> attempting to confine its magical cold attack, but
the effort was for naught. The abomination turned its power upon me, and I
felt the air freeze even as I finished the Litany. Pandeos heard my prayer
and granted the strength to make the <I>Repel Undead</I> effective, but I was
frozen in a casing of ice.
<BR>&nbsp; I do not know exactly what happened then as I struggled to free
myself. At some point Mystical dropped the Wall of Ice, Zem chopped off one
of the creature's legs, and for reasons I still do not understand Rosvenir
created an illusion to make himself appear exactly like the zombie
<I>[Editor's note: Rosvenir rolled a 66, causing him to cast a random spell
instead of the Starbolt he intended].</I> Endira shattered the ice encasing
me with a powerful note from her magical lute, but was then hit by its
attack and herself frozen. Zem rushed to free her while the rest of us
rained down attacks upon the creature until it died its second, and final,
death.

<P><A NAME="wandofdays"><U>The Narrator</U></A>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>&nbsp; A second enemy had been detected in the room across
the hall (marked &quot;D&quot; on the map). Rosvenir cast another
<I>Merging</I> spell to peek in. The room was quite small, and filled with
the broken remnants of marble statues. Only one statue remained intact,
lying on its side against the far wall. It had a cloth band with a metal
disk around its head, upon which Rosvenir detected a magical <I>Trigger</I>
of some sort. Deciding there was no reason to open this particular can of
whoop-ass the party continued exploration along the inner hallway.
<BR>&nbsp; Traversing several more empty rooms and a hallway led to a pie
shaped room (marked &quot;E&quot; on the map). Along the curved outer wall
were seven colorful panels upon which frost did not encroach. The seven
scenes depicted a path through various terrain, each at a different time of
day. Though the terrain varied greatly from frame to frame the path seemed
to connect at each edge to form an unbroken whole. The scenes depicted:
<OL>
	<LI>a path through a dark predawn forest
	<LI>a road through a grassy prarie at sunrise
	<LI>a steep mountain pass in the morning
	<LI>a path alongside a roaring river at noon
	<LI>a road leading through wide city gates in late afternoon
	<LI>a path through a tended garden at sunset
	<LI>a bridge over a chasm of darkness in dim twilight
</OL>
Breaking through the ice covering the floor revealed an elaborate mosaic,
with an inscription in the same demonic language used elsewhere in Moil.
Mystical was able to read it: &quot;Manifest the Power of the Wand of
Days.&quot; Rosvenir cast <I>Spell Typing</I> to determine that the panels
held a form of channeling magic, along with a trigger of some sort. He
believed that each panel had a slightly different magic enchanting it, and
that they all had the function of recharging something.
<BR>&nbsp; Returning to the hallway at &quot;B&quot; found it mostly cleared
of ice. At its end were tall double doors carved in a sunburst pattern. Haer
picked the lock and the doors swung easily open. The room beyond was tiny,
and the walls were obscured by an extremely thick layer of ice. The center
of the room and floor were completely clear, in which space stood a strange
metal pedestal topped with a curved apparatus holding a thin wooden wand.
The pedestal was carved with ornate runes, which Rosvenir deciphered using a
<I>Literacy</I> spell: &quot;The Choice of Days empowers the Wand, but the
Choice cannot be from here.&quot; Rosvenir detected a strange absence of
magic on the wand and pedestal, like a void where power should be.
<A NAME="wand"><BR></A>
&nbsp; Returning to room &quot;E&quot;, Kurik touched the wand to the
panel which depicted a path beside a river at noon. Nothing happened. When
the pedestal was set in the room and the wand placed back in its holder,
the wand began to glow slightly. When Kurik touched the panel again the
word &quot;kindle&quot; appeared on the wand and the panel glowed with a
soft light. When other panels were touched they would begin to glow and the
previous panel fade, but the word on the wand did not change. Removing the
wand from its holder, Rosvenir attuned to it. It is an Arcane device
which will activate when the person holding it speaks the word
&quot;kindle&quot;, projecting a light as bright as the sun. The wand has
ten charges.
<A NAME="ice"><BR></A>
&nbsp; Only two rooms remained to be explored, the two beyond room
&quot;D&quot;. Returning to one of the rooms near the tower entrance,
Mystical cast <I>Intangible Object</I> on the wall to allow passage.
The room marked &quot;F&quot; on the map was unremarkable save for a
cleared patch in the ice on the floor in the shape of a humanoid figure.
No explanation for the cleared patch was found. The room beyond was empty.
