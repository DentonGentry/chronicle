<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The party spends a few days
wrapping up<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the exploration of the
haunted mansion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Valek, Nibbler,
Dill, Shikata and Geneva decide to go to town to collect the silver promised
them by the town council, and to investigate Hughe’s potential link to the
smugglers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mandorallen decides to
join them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone else stays at
the mansion to make preparations for a journey, take care of the few smugglers
left alive and set a trap for the merchant who was helping the smugglers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In town they get money and thanks from
the council.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They tell the town
council about the illusionary ghosts, the gnolls, and the spiders, but do not
mention the smugglers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the
mention of the gnolls all the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>townspeople exhibit fear and relief at their dispatch, Mandorallen is
told that the Justicar is due the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A Justicar is a Knight of Tuon who travels regions resolving
disputes that town members cannot decide, and administering justice as
required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>A celebratory party begins at the
local bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many a good cheer and
drink are had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the party
even gets marriage proposals. During the revelry, Valek and Nibbler investigate
the warehouse/home of Hughe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
wait and watch for hours, as the evening goes to late night.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When finally the light goes dim, Valek
and Nibbler sneak into the warehouse while Hughe slept in a back room. They
found crates of dried fish and of normal merchandise for a small town, but
nothing terribly suspicious. Dill goes back to the mansion that evening and
finds out what a hangover feels like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The next day Mandorallen met the
Justicar in the town square, and told him about the captured smugglers. The
Justicar promised to return to the town in two days to check on them, after the
adventurers completed their investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The party decided to sting the “Hugo” (possibly Hughe) of
whom the captured smugglers had told when the delivery is made.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Erilyn (Will) and Eowyn (Sanralet) make
an appearance as Sanralet and Will at a preplanned meeting area. Hughe rolls up
in his wagon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He begins to suspect
something is up when questioned about the details of where the shipments are
taken, and other inconsistencies. However, he seems most intent on not being
killed by these two, as he believes his bodyguard Ned has been. He allows
“Will” to go with him as a guard in place of Ned, the thief the party found
tied up in the house. As soon as practical Eowyn switches with Erilyn to
impersonate Will, as Eowyn is much better at it and can have a male body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Hughe and Will follow the river
for a four days, with the party following covertly well behind. It rains
constantly the entire time. Hughe makes a &quot;deal&quot; with
&quot;Will&quot; to let him go and he will disappear, rather than kill him, as
he believed &quot;Sanralet&quot; had threatened. Hughe believed that Sanralet
allowed him to live only because Sanralet doesn’t know where the rendezvous
point is to drop off the weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the fourth day they experience an earthquake that jolts the earth up
a few feet throws the party off it's feet, breaks a wagon wheel, and breaks
open a crate when it falls off the wagon. Earthquakes are completely unknown,
thus making this a strange event. Hughe fixes the wagon then helps grudgingly
put the weapons back in the crate appearing surprised they are there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They continue to the drop off point
where Hughe waits patiently and quietly until 18 men and half-orcs come to take
the weapons, drop off the payment and then leave on three barges they have
steered down the river Irda. The barges are already laden, and hold 16 crates
altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Will” allows Hughe to
leave with a promise to “disappear”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>
<IMG SRC="dog.jpg" ALT="Dog of War Medallion" WIDTH=256 HEIGHT=192 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0>
Through Shikatas hawk (Tomoe),
the party keeps tabs on the three barges as they move down the river. The party
falls behind, as the swollen creeks feeding into the Irda slow their progress.
Once they catch up they find a battle scene. They find two barges grappled to
the shore using finely woven steel cables and grapples. A Death’s Tale spell on
one of the bodies revealed that they had been ambushed by dwarves. Scattered
about the shore were pieces of 14 of the crates, 11 runners dead, 9 dwarves on
a funeral pyre, and a sunken barge with two crates holding it to the bottom of
the river. They believe the rest of the bodies were swept away by the fast
moving current. A search of the bodies turned up two amulets embossed with the
head of a dog, and a string of roman numerals. These were the symbols of the
Dogs of War, the Guild of Fighters in the port city of Phaeros. Nibbler got
caught by Shikata palming coins from the dead runners. Shikata then read the
tracks to figure out the course of the battle, and that two dwarves had
survived the battle. One of the dwarves was wounded and being helped along by
the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Shikata tracks the two dwarves
towards the woods. They follow to find a circle of stones surrounding an open
trap door that guards stairs going down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mandorallen and Geneva are reminded of a story of the Fortress of Ash,
sunken on the Day of Reckoning(*). They follow the footprints down, get
attacked by 3 dire rats which are fairly quickly dispatched. Mandorallen cast
Disease Purification on Shikata and Valek, who had been bitten. They get to the
bottom and find kobold bodies with the footprints going towards two doors on
opposite sides of the room. The first door leads to a room which has collapsed,
half burying another door on the far side. They decided the dwarves had not
gone that way. Once they choose the other door, they find another battle scene
with an empty cage, and a cowering goblin. While Eowyn shape-shifts to a pretty
female goblin and discusses with Meepo what was in the cage &quot;Fire dragon.
Stolen by kobolds&quot; and if other dwarves came through &quot;Stolen by
kobolds&quot;, the others investigate the room.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Valek opens a door for the shock of his life. . . Shikata
examined another door, which was partly open, saw a animal hide stretched
across a copper cone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:0in;mso-text-indent-alt:
0in'>(*) The Day of Reckoning was the shining event in the history of the
Knights of Tuon. Sixty years ago, the forces of the Taar D’taal (mainly Orcs,
Ogres, and other savage races) held much of the country under their control.
The Knights of Tuon, guided by information from the Church of Teleron, planned
an audacious offensive. Liveries were raised and trained, and allocated to each
major fortress of the Taar D’Taal. Attacks were launched simultaneously on a
single day, denying the enemy the ability to reinforce their strongholds. Given
complete and unfailingly accurate information about the disposition of the Taar
d’Taal by Teleron, the Knights were able to anticipate and counter every
maneuver. The Knights won a resounding victory, freeing much of the countryside
from slavery.</p>
