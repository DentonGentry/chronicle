<H2>The Unravelling, <I>Reloaded</I></H2>

The Unravelling is a world just beginning to recover from cataclysm. The
world was plunged into chaos centuries ago by the appearance of the Tumult,
violent conflagrations of raw Essence which swept across land and sea. These
Maelstrom have ripped up the ancient civilization of the Overlords, and
irrevocably altered the patterns of life for those who remain. Thirty years
ago the Tumult began to wane, until in the present day the Storms are
encountered more often in stories than in actual fact.

<P>The most perilous danger is not that the fabric of society has been ripped
apart by the Tumult. It is that the pieces which remain have begun to unravel
at the edges.

<P>The Unravelling campaign commenced in 2001, went on abrupt hiatus in late 2002. It reactivated in 2004, when it also converted from Rolemaster to D&D 3.5 rules. This story arc of the campaign concluded in 2005, the players having disrupted an extensive weapons smuggling network.

<P>History, cultures, and assorted information about the campaign are
introduced in a series of web pages below.
