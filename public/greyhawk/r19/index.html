<h2>Chapter 19: Advancing the Plot by a Hair</h2>
&nbsp;<br><img src="../fonts/E.gif" alt="E" border=0 height=72 width=75 align=left hspace=3 vspace=1>dwin was in his element: ensconced in the Wizard's Tower in Greyhawk, amongst the most famous and most extensive collection of arcane lore on Oerth. Edwin spent the mornings researching in the library, and the evenings enchanting items.

<br clear=left>

<div id="research"><div id="researcht">Edwin's Research</div>
<p><u>The Staff of Law</u>
<br>&nbsp; Each segment of the staff has a different power, and as segments are assembled they gain new powers via resonance with each other.

<p><u>Wind Dukes</u>
<br>&nbsp; Also known as the Vaati, the Wind Dukes make their home in the Vale of Aaqa, which is somewhere in the outer planes. The vale is magically protected such that it is impossible to gate or teleport in. The Vaati are the original immortal race dedicated to pure Law. The Vaati existed as a race before the concepts of Good and Evil came into being. Over time a few Vaati have drifted towards good or evil, but all remain Lawful (and the majority are Lawful Neutral).
<br>&nbsp; A few of the Wind Dukes are still searching for the Staff of Law, to keep it from falling into the hands of Chaos. In their long separation from the rest of their race they have drifted towards Lawful Good. They are considered outcasts.
<br>&nbsp; The Vaati appear as seven foot tall, statuesque, androgynous humans with ebony skin and white eyes. They have their own language, which sounds like a series of high pitched whistles.

<p><u>Wolf Spider Demons</u>
<br>&nbsp; The wolf spiders are <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/demon.htm">Tanar'ii</a> in service to the <a href="../r9/index.html#staffhistory">Queen of Chaos</a>. There are five types, each of which becomes stronger and more intelligent. All five types can shoot webs. Some have functional arms. As tanar'ii they are resistant or immune to cold, electricity, fire, and poison.

<p><u>Miksa the Wolf Spider</u>
<br>&nbsp; <a href="../r9/index.html#staffhistory">Miska</a> was completely unknown until he became the General of the Armies of Chaos. Until that point the forces of Law and Chaos had fought to a stalemate. Miska turned the tide of battle, and the Wind Dukes constructed the Staff of Law specifically to kill him.
<br>&nbsp; When Miska was pierced with the staff it created a wound of pure Law, which will not heal. Even to this day Miska carries the wound. Miska can regenerate from any other injury, nothing save the staff can permanently kill him. Miska's weakness is therefore the staff; however, the staff is stained with Miska's blood. If Miska can get his hands on the staff he can withdraw his blood from it and use it to heal himself.
<br>&nbsp; Miska is imprisoned somewhere on the plane of Pandemonium.
<br>&nbsp; The ritual to rejoin the segments of the staff does not expunge Miska's blood, it merely suppresses the Chaos sufficiently for the pieces to be rejoined. There is no known way to remove the blood staining the staff.</div>

<p><u>Chaden</u>
<br>&nbsp; Chaden spent her the days searching Greyhawk for people who had experienced the incursions of chaos or the demonic wolf-spiders. Given the close proximity of the newly-created <a href="../r18/index.html#vastestbog">Vastest Bog</a> she asked many people about it, but everyone seemed to think it had always been there. All of Greyhawk had been changed in subtle ways, and many areas of the town were seedier than they had been. There were definitely more beggars.
<br>&nbsp; Chaden heard tell of a talented street performer, whose act consisted of small white mice performing amazing tricks. The performer was described as a tall female human wearing a loose robe and turban. Chaden and Kaerick spent several days seeking out a performance, finally discovering the woman performing before a large crowd. One rat perched upon her shoulder, she said, &quot;Applause, please.&quot; as the rat dove into a bucket of water. There were seven rats altogether, performing on a rickety platform of sticks and strings. The crowd found it very entertaining. Chaden and Kaerick noticed a few pickpockets working the crowd, but did not see any coordination between the performer and the thieves and concluded they were probably just opportunists. Kaerick was quite certain that the woman was not casting spells or using magic, the rats appeared to be doing the tricks naturally.
							<span id="quote1">&quot;Are the little white mice by any
							chance searching for the Ultimate Answer to Life, the
							Universe, and Everything?&quot; </span>
<br>&nbsp; At the end of the show Chaden approached the performer as she walked toward a nearby alley. Giving the entire proceeds of her performance to a group of orphaned children, the woman said, &quot;Would you mind walking outside the city? I don't want to be overheard. Would your friends like to join us?&quot;
<br>&nbsp; Chaden quickly returned to the Inn and to the Wizards Tower to collect the rest of the adventurers. Edwin immediately concluded that the rats must be were-rats but Chaden disagreed, saying she had a hunch that the performer was actually one of the <a href="../r9/index.html#vaati">Vaati</a>. The two laid a small wager on the outcome.

		grasp. The only way to redirect her attention is to move the staff to another world.
		If the staff breaks apart it will scatter across the planes. It can be broken apart
		simply by desiring it to do so. Once fully assembled, the best way to break it is to
		invoke its full power, which is resurrection.</td></tr>

<tr><td id="archestanq">When the staff transports itself away, how does it pick its
		destination?</td>
	<td id="archestana">The staff does not decide where to go. Whenever it reappears, the

		been fully reassembled. Its resurrection power was used, and it broke apart
		again.</td></tr>

<tr><td id="archestanq">Can we break the Queen's hold without breaking the staff apart?</td>
	<td id="archestana">You will need to reassemble the staff, allow Miska to touch it to

<p><u>Chaden's Orphanage</u>
<br>&nbsp; Having grown up as an orphan on the streets of Greyhawk, Chaden asked about the children to whom Archestan had given the coins. All of the charitable organizations Chaden remembered from her own childhood were no more: the incursions of Chaos in Greyhawk had removed them from history. As Edwin would need several more weeks to complete the weapon enchantments the party needed, Chaden spent the time renting space and setting up the funding for a new orphanage. She hoped the lingering influence of the Staff of Law would prevent it from being erased by another incursion.

<p><u>The Search for a Lawful Evil Hair</u>
<br>&nbsp; One might think that the best place to find a Lawful Evil hair would be a dockside tavern, where the grim and desperate can oft be found. One would be incorrect in this assumption. Though evil can be found in great multitude in such places, it is hardly ever of the lawful variety. No, the place to find Lawful Evil is both cleaner and better lit than those. It is a place where heartless efficiency is not avoided, but strived for. The best place to find pure Lawful Evil ... is the halls of government.
<br>&nbsp; Fortunately the bureaucrats, clerks, and other functionaries have many of the same needs and desires as other, better men. Katriana was able to find one such. In gratitude he gave her a lock of hair from his head, to remember him by.

<p><u>The Staff of Law</u>
<br>&nbsp; The party stayed in Greyhawk for three weeks, researching, provisioning, and enchanting. At the end of that time, Edwin incorporated the Lawful Good and Lawful Evil hairs into a brush and began the ritual to rejoin the first and second segments. After inscribing the glyphs he brought the two pieces together. They hovered in the air for a moment, then flew together with an audible &quot;click&quot;. The assembled segments retained their <i>Cure Light Wounds</i> and <i>Slow</i> abilities, and also granted the ability to <i>Fly.</i>
<br>&nbsp; Though the adventurers had cast various defensive magics in expectation of a demonic ambush, no attack was forthcoming. The pull of the third segment came from the west.

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><u>The Narrator</u>
<br>&nbsp; Edwin cast <i>Shadow Walk,</i> and the party travelled for nearly twelve hours to cover approximately 590 miles. They emerged well after dark near the Lormil mountains, and rested for the night in a <i>Leomund's Tiny Hut.</i> The next morning Katriana cast <i>Mass Camoflage,</i> and they set out to climb the foothills. The Staff of Law pulled upward, indicating the third segment was up in the mountains somewhere.
<br>&nbsp; A thin plume of smoke rose from the scraggly trees a few hundred feet below the party. Edwin cast <i>Rary's Mnemonic Bond</i> and Katriana turned into an eagle, flying back to investigate while the rest of the party trudged onward. She saw a clearing with a large bonfire of broken furniture and various bags and backpacks. Two dead fire giants sprawled at one end of the clearing, while a mixed group of elderly humans and orcs were drinking and celebrating. She heard distinct cries of &quot;Freedom! We're free!&quot; The rest of the party came to investigate.

<a name="slaves">&nbsp;</a> The inebriated orcs and humans were very friendly. They had been slaves of Siiri Dragosdottur, the &quot;worst giant witch who ever lived!&quot; She resides in the fire giant caves at the base of the mountain. They had been carrying furnishings up the mountain to the castle of the cloud giants. Siiri's daughter is to marry a cloud giant, cementing an alliance between them. The slaves had not killed the fire giant guards (they would have been slaughtered had they tried), and did not know what had attacked as they scattered at the first sign of trouble. When they crept back the giants were dead, so they smashed and burned all of the furniture and broke open the nuptial wine.
<br>&nbsp; Chaden searched the giant bodies but found no obvious wounds or burns. She did not know what killed them. She gave the minor gems they carried to the former slaves.

<p>&nbsp; The slaves knew very little else of use. There is a wide trail leading all the way up to the castle, where many cloud giants (and a few fire giants) live. The two clans have invited representatives of other giant races to the wedding as well. The leader of the cloud giants is Urick.

<div id="ecology">Cloud giants skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass, and their eyes are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells.
<br><div id="ecologyf"><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/">--d20 SRD</a></div></div>

<p><a name="kirin"></a><u>The Narrator</u></a>
<br>&nbsp; The party located the trail leading to the castle. After a mere ten minutes of walking they heard a voice from behind them: &quot;Halt, you varlots! Declare yourselves or you're icicles.&quot; On the trail about fifty feet behind was a very small silver dragon, about twelve feet from head to tail. The party introduced themselves, and the dragon said his name was Kirin. &quot;My mom and dad left <u>me</u> in charge,&quot; he bragged breathlessly, &quot;Have you seen my sister?&quot;
<br>&nbsp; Kirin's younger sister, a wyrmling named Arielle, was missing. Kirin's parents thought she might have tried to eat silver from the clouds, and been captured by the giants. The dragons were trying to rescue her, and had killed the fire giants in the clearing. Kirin had been put in charge of guarding the road (presumably, because they thought it would keep him away from the castle and out of danger). Kirin had stopped another party of travellers yesterday, a pair of pale skinned elves on a flying rug. They turned nasty so he had blasted them with his breath weapon, but did not hurt them. &quot;They made the air stink, and then I flew away,&quot; explained Kirin. Edwin thought it had likely been a <i>Cloudkill</i> spell.
