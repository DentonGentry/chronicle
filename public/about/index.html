<H3>Interesting links</H3>
If you enjoy this site, I am gratified. I'll also suggest a few other sites
for your persusal:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.giantitp.com/cgi-bin/GiantITP/ootscript">OOTS!</A> The Order of the Stick webcomic is a favorite of all of the players in this gaming group.

<LI>Edward Keyes wrote a series of tales of
<A HREF="http://www.edkeyes.org/fiction/">Korel
the Necromancer</A>. Korel was a character in his AD&D campaign.
Some of the stories are from their gaming sessions and some are original
fantasy. "Patientia Est Virtus" in particular is excellent.

<LI>And then there is the grand-daddy of them all,
<A HREF="http://www.peldor.com/">The Adventurers</A>. Thomas Miller has been
writing the continuous story of an AD&D campaign since 1992. The body of
work is quite extensive, and makes an interesting read if you've got a
couple months of free time.

<H3>Helper Software</H3>
You'll need a few plug-ins and helper applications to get the full
experience from this site.

	There are a number of images scattered throughout the Chronicle,
	illustrating scenes from the adventures. Being set in dungeons and
	other dim and scary places, these images tend to be quite dark.
	Unfortunately, "dark" on one monitor is "mid-grey" on another,
	making it quite difficult to generate images which look good on
	everyone's screen.
	<BR>This is where you can help. It is fairly simple to turn on
	color correction on your computer, to try to make different monitors
	correspond more closely. On a Macintosh this is done using ColorSync.
	On Windows, look for an item named "Gamma Correction" in the Advanced
	section of the Displays control panel; it should be set to about 1.8.
