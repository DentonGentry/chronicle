his chronicler, in the interests of skipping the boring between adventure
filler material, will simply skip ahead to find the party back at Edwin's
shop. True, portions of said filler are somwehat entertaining, such as the
account  of the battle with the killer platypii of the Unlife after narrowly
escaping the confines of the First Pail using the Holy Chisel of the
Ascension. Nonetheless, in the interests of brevity we skip all that.

<BR>&nbsp; "Whoa, like how'd we get here?", asked Sasfiry.

<P>&nbsp; "Aye, and wha' of them bastard platypus? I dinnae remember
those.", drawled Sigmund.

<P>&nbsp; "Thats because the Narrator didn't bother to write them in",
explained Loremaster Edwin. "Now, on to business. There is a great evil
buried in an abandoned complex in the Great Swamp, many miles south of
Greyhawk."

<P>&nbsp; "Greyhawk? Who's he?", asked Urk. "I've never heard of him. Is
he related to Blackhawk?"

<P>&nbsp; Blackhawk stared at Urk as though he were some kind of moron.
Somewhat redundantly, he intoned, "Its a city, you moron."

<P>&nbsp; "Never mind that right now. I'll find an alligator to guide you
there, or something. In any case, your mission is to go to the Tomb and
destroy the evil there once and for all.", continued Edwin.

<P>&nbsp; "Like, why?", asked Sasfiry, in all earnestness. "Like, maybe we
shouldn't just barge in on the evil dudes all the time trying to blow them
away. Maybe we should like, talk to them and let them work out their issues
so they won't be so bad anymore. Like, make love, not war, right?"

<P>&nbsp; "The rotting, decaying undead minions of evil, thats who you want
to make love to?", asked Edwin.

<P>&nbsp; "Eww! No, not if they're gross. Then we just kill them", affirmed
Sasfiry.

<P>&nbsp; "Good. Now that that's settled, there will be a few more brave
adventurers joining you for this mission. They should be here at any time.",
concluded Edwin. Frisbee strolled over to the freshly burned circular hole
in the wall and looked for anyone approaching the shop. At this Edwin cast a
nasty look at Blackhawk, who had wisely chosen to examine a book well away
from the site of the little plasmanator incident.

<P>&nbsp; "Pit traps there, there, and there", said Fry, walking quickly
down the hallway. The other adventurers pretended to ignore Fry's babbling
but studiously avoided stepping on the areas he pointed out.

<P>&nbsp; Blackhawk had been looking down as he walked, attempting to read
the text inlaid in the tile. He looked up just before reaching the end of
the hallway and found himself face to face with an enormous, grinning
demonic viseage. His combat reflexes sharp as ever, Blackhawk squeezed off
two rounds from the Plasmanator before anyone could blurt out that it
was just a stone carving of a demonic face, not a demon at all. Blackhawk
slowly lowered the gun barrel, daring the statue to prove the others
wrong.

<P>&nbsp; Strangely, both blasts of the energy weapon had hit the open mouth
of the carving, where an inky black shadow stubbornly held. Neither bolt
had any visible effect on impact, it was as if the mouth had simpy swallowed
the supercritical plasma. Shizlink found this intriguing, and began sweeping
the area with the multiscanner. "One more", he said, and Blackhawk gladly
obligued with another plasma bolt which was similarly swallowed.
"Good", said Shizlink. The sphere of annihilation in the carving's mouth
was now a perfect black body heated to a temperature of 6500 degrees, the
standard color setting for NTSC television. Shizlink carefully adjusted
the multiscanner controls: <I>Austin Powers</I> would look so much better
on a properly calibrated screen. "We go now", said the goblin.

Jobe is a blithering idiot. "You point, me punch" At end of adventurehe is infused
with genius-level intelligence.
