<H1>Destiny Revealed</H1>
<H5>by Marc Mangus</H5>
<HR>


<P>Zembahk ("Zem") is heir to the Kaydian magical legacy.  His name is not a 
family name per se, but rather the race of people he comes from.  They are 
a humanoid variant that live cut off in a valley shrouded by magical mists 
and protection spells.  The Kaydian were highly developed while the younger 
races of Man were still wrapped in furs and carrying clubs.  They made 
pacts and alliances with various unseen forces in exchange for power. 
Without the influx of to their culture and due to their rather perverse 
fascination with all things Arcane, the Kaydian became decadent and 
self-involved to the point where it has become pathological.  No one ever 
leaves the valley and the various nobles war with each other for control of 
the Empire and the legacy.  Technically, Zem is a prince.  He is of the 
royal line of the last Emperor and is the bastard son of one of that man's 
many concubines.  Currently there is no Emperor controlling the Kaydian and 
they are on the brink of civil war.  Political power lies with the leaders 
of various great houses which vie for control either directly through 
violence or indirectly through more subtle, magical means.

<P>Zem is an outcast among the nobles for many reasons, not the least of which 
is that he was born with a flaw that makes him the object of persecution 
and ridicule.  He must expend a great deal of physical energy to work magic 
(flaw: power burn).  Since he was shunned at  an early age he spent a lot 
of time by himself and made the races outside the valley, the "younger 
races" the object of his undivided attention.  Through the various Kaydian 
scrying devices he was able to observe the various races and cultures of 
the planet.  He began to mimic the aspects of the cultures he liked and 
became fascinated by physical combat; a practice all but abandoned by the 
Kaydian.  They much prefer to employ otherworldly minions to fight their 
battles or if pressed, to fight magical duels.  Zem in particular fixated 
on a renowned fighting order known as the Blood Moon School and spent years 
studying their ways.  He also learned to adapt his relatively meager 
magical ability (by Kaydian standards) to enhance his abilities.

<P>Perhaps because he is the last in the direct royal line or perhaps due to 
his martial nature, Zem is the favored of the War God Adorok.  Adorok 
doesn't participate directly in Zem's life but he tends to act as his 
protector from the otherworldly creatures the Kaydian usually deal with on 
a daily basis.  As such, it is much harder for Zem to call on them for aid 
when he tries and his magical abilities in that area are limited to very 
minor creatures.  Adorok is an inscrutable and fickle god and aids or 
ignores Zem as is his whim.  He does impose quests on Zem from time to time 
presumably to increase his power on the material plane.

<P>When the last Emperor died, the succession was in dispute.  Zem and a 
second cousin were both backed by different factions vying for control. 
Zem had become disgusted with his own culture and had no interest in rule. 
In fact, he longed to leave the Valley of Mists to pursue his own 
interests among the younger races.  Scheming to murder him, his cousin 
Sunaj made a pact with a particularly loathsome chaos creature (Ordainer 
demon).  The creature came upon Zem in the night and attempted to kill him. 
On this occasion Adorok decided to intervene, albeit indirectly.  He 
opened a portal to a plane inhabited by beings that, for lack of a better 
description, represented "aspects" of extreme emotion.  On their plane, 
they had no shape.  On this plane they take on the shape of the first and 
strongest will or desire they encounter.  The aspect of Hunger was 
attracted by the impending conflict between Zem and the demon and came 
through the gate.  Zem, terrified, sought desperately for his trusty 
Claymore to fend off this demon.  The aspect of Hunger became that weapon 
and took the form of the familiar weapon.  To Zem, a two-handed sword 
materialized out of thin air in front of him.  He grabbed it and struck the 
demon.  A horrible keening scream rose from the blade as the battle ensued. 
It could be said that perhaps any other Kaydian at the time if pressed 
into physical combat such as this would have surely perished.  Due to Zem's 
years mastering all things martial, he lay into the creature with a 
ferocity and skill both terrible and beautiful to behold.  He employed the 
spells he had learned to enhance his combat abilities to deadly effect. 
Suddenly, the battle was over.  The demon disappeared from the material 
plane with a shriek of rage and Zem, nearly mortally wounded, collapsed 
into blackness.

<P>With the aid of several restorative spells he had learned to heal him 
subconsciously, Zem awoke imprisoned in the royal dungeons.  Naked except 
for a simple loincloth and with no weapons, he knew his cousin was 
responsible and that it was unlikely anyone would ever find him.  As he 
became fully conscious he heard the familiar sounds of battle outside his 
cell door.  He ran to the door and pressed his ear to the rough wood.  He 
listened as the death rattle of a guard echoed against the door.  Suddenly, 
the door shook with the blow of a strong blade.  He immediately stepped 
back and watched in wonder as the door was hacked to pieces in just a few 
minutes.  Awestruck, he watched the blade with which he had fought off the 
demon glide through the door under its own power and settle gently at his 
feet.  Not willing to look askance at such an obvious turn in his fortunes, 
Zem grabbed the blade and rushed from the cell deftly leaping over the 
corpses of the fallen guards.

<P>Zem reached his rooms and quickly gathered his belongings, already packed 
for a long journey.  He had been researching a means to pierce the Veil of 
Mists and leave the valley for years.  He had become convinced that the 
only way to save his people was to infuse them with the lust for life, 
love, and altruism he had observed in the younger races.  He must walk 
among them and learn their ways.  He grabbed the fabulous jewel that would 
serve as his key to open a pathway through the Veil and rushed from the 
palace under the cloak of darkness.  "Let my cousin wear the crown uneasily 
upon his brow" he thought.  "I'll return with a power he won't know how to 
fight."  "I'll return and pull the crown from his cold, dead hands".
