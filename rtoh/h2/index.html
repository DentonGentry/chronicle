<H2>Chapter 2: Giants and Fire and Traps, Oh My!</H2>
<H4>"This adventure sponsored by the number 69 and the letter OUCH" -- Kurik</H4>

aving defeated the two giants the adventurers were finally able to examine
their surroundings. The shifting slope of shale led to a high mountain valley,
surrounded on three sides by solid rock. The valley was seven hundred feet long
and roughly the same width at its widest point. At the far end and built
against a steep cliff was a small fortress, presumably that of Desatysso. It
was a single story fortified manor house with a tower on one side. Once
surrounded by a courtyard of red brick, it was now heavily overgrown.
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp; Kurik went back to a stream at the base of the rock slope to wash
himself of the enormous quantities of giant blood absorbed in his clothing and
gear. Upon his return the group spread out and walked slowly across the valley,
scanning the ridges above and to the sides. Rosvenir cast a <I>Presence</I>
spell, which located only his companions and the local fauna until they had
travelled nearly two thirds of the distance to the keep. Two hundred and fifty
feet away the spell detected four conscious minds from inside the structure. A
subsequent <I>Mind Typing</I> determined that They Might Be Giants.
<BR>&nbsp;

<A HREF="pov.html"><IMG SRC="keep.jpg" ALT="Keep" BORDER=0
	HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=3 VSPACE=1></A>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>&nbsp; Working quickly, Haer cast <I>Unseen</I> spells upon
himself and Rosvenir, then created an illusionary halfling. The illusion looked
a great deal like Haer, and appeared to have just stumbled and cancelled its
invisibility. Moving slowly, the false Haer motioned at the other adventurers
to stay back, then crept towards the mansion. When the illusion had crept to
optimum boulder throwing range (about two hundred feet) four giants rushed out
of the keep. The giants hurled large rocks, and hit with all four. Haer made
the illusionary halfling fall to the ground convincingly, as if actually struck
by the missiles.

<P>&nbsp; Meanwhile Mystical had cast a <I>Reduce Gravity</I> spell affecting a
spherical area between the giants and the party, so that any hurled boulders
would have their flight path modified and soar harmlessly overhead. She then
caused a small brush fire in the grass as an additional distraction. When the
four giants attacked the illusionary halfling, Kurik drew his battle axe and
charged toward them.

<P>&nbsp; Rosvenir teleported to one side of the keep as soon as the four
rushed out of the entrance. He produced a <I>Light Eruption</I> in front of the
closest giant, but a stroke of bad luck had the giant close its eyes and resist
the spell. Rosvenir ducked behind the corner of the keep, and soon a more
powerfully cast <I>Light Eruption</I> stunned the two closest giants.

<P>&nbsp; Slowly, the invulnerable halfling picked itself up from the ground
where it had been flattened. Reaching over its back to draw an impossibly large
sword, it rushed towards the keep at a run. This confused the giants immensely
as they had never seen an enemy get up after being hit by four boulders. Thus
they were distracted from the real threat: Kurik. The giants sent another rock
crashing into the faux hobbit, and one at Kurik which bounced off of the
<I>Deflections</I> spell he had previously cast.

<P>&nbsp; Mystical and Kahlen also rushed towards the giants, though they
could not run as quickly as the paladin. Haer walked slowly across the field
while concentrating to control the spell. When the faux halfling was hit by
the second attack Haer was unable to make it fall convincingly: the boulder
had quite obviously passed through the illusion. Deciding it had served its
purpose Haer left his fake twin lying on the ground and ran towards the keep
behind everyone else (halfling legs being shorter than most). Rosvenir
peeked out from behind the corner to cast a <I>Blindness</I> spell on the
third giant causing it to grab its head and panic, running away from the
keep.

<P>&nbsp; Kurik reached the giants first. Screaming a war cry he hacked at the
fourth giant. Unfortunately the creature held another boulder which it had
prepared to throw and instead brought down heavily on Kurik's head. The
paladin's helmet rang like a bell and he was knocked unconscious. The giant
raised the boulder above its head, preparing to finish the job.

<P>&nbsp; Mystical and Kahlen were at this point almost a hundred feet away
from Kurik. Kahlen skidded to a stop and loosed an arrow, grazing the giant's
forehead and causing it to stagger back a step. Mystical put up a <I>Circle of
Fire</I> as she ran, placing the barrier between the giant and the fallen
paladin. Haer used the teleportation ability of his cloak to move closer to the
keep, and quickly cast a <I>Sleep</I> spell which found its target. The giant
fell into a deep magical slumber, dropping the boulder and pitching forward
into the fire where its loincloth and body hair caught fire.

<P>&nbsp; Reaching the keep at roughly the same time Kahlen pulled Kurik away
from the flames and began to administer aid while Mystical slit the throat of
the giant who had threatened him. This left two giants on the field, as one of
the two stunned by Rosvenir's <I>Light Eruption</I> had staggered back into the
keep and barred the door. One of the two remaining giants was running fast
away, but couldn't see to run straight and came about in a wide circle back
towards the keep. The other giant had been menacing Rosvenir, but two
<I>Starbolts</I> had crippled both of its legs. Haer sent a sling bolt at that
one, breaking its hand.

<P>&nbsp; Kahlen knelt next to the wounded paladin. The blow to the head had
been severe, but not fatal. Kurik had a concussion which would leave him
unconscious and defenseless for hours. This simply would not do in the middle
of a battlefield. Kahlen used healing magics to repair the bruising to the
skull and grey matter, and poured energy into the paladin to help him recover.
Then she slapped him. Kurik came instantly awake.

<P>&nbsp; The blind giant had come full circle. It ran straight into and
through the flaming circle, where in a continuing plot thread its loincloth
caught fire. Unfortunately just past the circle of fire was the wall of the
keep into which the giant barrelled head first. The ground shook from the
impact, and the giant crumpled heavily. Mystical decided to take the
opportunity thus presented. Dropping the flaming circle, she crouched beside
the fallen giant and cast <I>Mind Probe.</I>

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT><PRE>
<I><A NAME="mindprobe">Who is your leader?</A>
    Clear image of female giant, standing inside a stone room pointing
    at a metal door, indicating to go out and face the intruders.
    Image fades, followed by an older female giant bossing the young
    female about.

How did you come to this place?
    A happy image of giant toddlers running around a brightly
    lit castle, with several older giant females tending to them.
    The castle is well furnished in the memory, with bright red
    pavestones surrounding it.</I>
</PRE>

<P>&nbsp; Rosvenir sent a third <I>Starbolt</I> crashing into the giant facing
him. Said giant had crouched down to pick up a boulder and so the bolt struck
it midsection and, you guessed it, set its loincloth on fire. The giant decided
that putting out the flames was top priority, and dropped the rock. Kahlen took
careful aim and sent an arrow straight into its left eye. The giant fell to the
ground, quite dead, with its loincloth burning merrily.

<P>&nbsp; The blinded giant stood, and shook its head. It was impossible to
know if it could feel the <I>Mind Probe</I> or even conceive of what was
happening. The only thing certain was that the blindness had worn off: the
giant reached down to grab a nearby club. Kurik was back in action, and swung
his axe in a wide arc knocking the club from the giant's hand and continuing on
to break its lower leg. The giant stumbled back against the wall of the castle.

<PRE>
<I>Are there any humans living in the castle?

    at a desk. Viewpoint shifts to turn away from the desk; the giant
    is running an errand for the man. The castle is in good repair in
    the vision. The memory is an old one.</I>
</PRE>

<P>&nbsp; The giant swung a meaty fist at Kurik, narrowly missing. Kurik's axe
struck again.

<PRE>
<I>Are there any secret places in the castle?
    Wave of tangible fear. Dim vision of a rough hewn cave,
    too small for a giant to traverse.</I>

<P>&nbsp; Kurik's final backswing finished the creature.

<PRE>
<I>Are there any hidden items in the castle?
    Vision fading to black. Can barely see a pile of tattered
    cloth and tapestries.</I>
</PRE>

<P>&nbsp; The giant died. Mystical ended the spell.

<P>&nbsp; The fourth giant had fled back into the keep during the battle,
barring the door. An impressive edifice, the door was ten feet wide, fifteen
feet high, and made of solid steel. It was encased in a black enamel, chipped
in places, and embossed with runes. With at least three giants inside (the one
who fled and the two females revealed via Mystical's spell) it was decided that
a frontal assault would be stupid. Several other potential entrances were
noted. The third floor of the tower had collapsed and was open to the sky.
Several windows gave access to the second floor, though they were too small for
anyone save Haer to squeeze through.
<BR>&nbsp;

<IMG SRC="keep1.gif" ALT="Keep Floorplan" BORDER=0 USEMAP="#keep"
	HEIGHT=364 WIDTH=308 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=3 VSPACE=2>

<BR>&nbsp; The best option seemed to be the tower. Everyone climbed or flew up
and into the hollow shell of the building, the interior having collapsed long
ago. Broken beams and rubble were strewn about the floor. The tower was
circular, twenty feet in radius, and judging from the debris scattered about
had once housed a magical workshop and study. Broken wands and staves and other
once-magical paraphernalia peeked from beneath the trash. Haer went immediately
to the double doors to one side, checking the circular pull for traps. He was
rewarded with signs of an intricate mechanism which would trigger something if
pulled. It was easily disabled.


<P><A NAME="key">&nbsp;</A> Mystical searched the room while Haer worked on the
trap, and found a nearly invisible crack in the floor. Using a thin crowbar the
hidden compartment was opened, revealing a small silver key. The key radiated
no magic.

<P>&nbsp; Various party members cast <I>Detect Life, Detect Enemies,
Presence,</I> etc. Only one being was located in the castle, and it was very
close. <I>Life Typing</I> determined that the creature was completely alien.
Mystical felt like she knew what sort of creature it was, but couldn't quite
place it. Rosvenir cast <I>Merge Stone,</I> allowing him to slowly walk through
the wall of the tower towards the presence. He walked to the edge of the next
room, which looked like a fireplace in which an enormous fire roared. Even from
two inches within the stone Rosvenir could feel the heat. Strangely, there was
no fuel for the fire, it burned as if from the bare rock. It was an elemental.

<P>&nbsp; A battle plan developed. Spells providing resistance to heat and fire
were cast, plus general defensive magics. Kurik would pull the door wide and
Mystical would create a <I>Wall of Ice</I> to trap the elemental within the
fireplace.


<P><A NAME="elemental">&nbsp;</A> Things didn't work quite as planned. The
instant Kurik pulled the door open the elemental darted from the fireplace
towards the doors. Rosvenir let a <I>Vacuum</I> spell fly, stopping the living
flame and causing it to stagger back a step. Thinking quickly, Mystical shaped
the wall of ice into a cylinder stretching floor to ceiling, trapping the
elemental within. A wall of water and a second wall of ice were quickly cast,
surrounding the first. A dancing light could be seen trapped deep inside, but
the walls held. After several minutes everyone relaxed their stance, and Haer
examined the door on the far side of the chamber. The rest searched the room,
finding nothing of note.

<P>&nbsp; Leaving the trapped elemental behind, the next room was explored. It
had been a dining area, the remains of a large oak table and chandelier laying
on the floor. The room beyond was the entrance hall, where a slime choked
fountain dominated the center of the room. The giants had left a smoldering
fire pit in one corner and had barred the door, but then apparently fled. Kurik
unbarred the door in case a quick exit was needed, and Haer placed a
<I>Sensory Marker</I> to be able to magically scry the area later.

<P>&nbsp; Two doors remained. The far door led to a bed chamber, with a pile
of smashed wood and silk and little else. <I>[Editor's note: though in an
amazing statistical coincidence Mystical and Kurik both rolled 69 on their
Locate Hidden rolls, one of many such rolls throughout the session].</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<A HREF="pov.html"><IMG SRC="tunnel.jpg" ALT="Tunnel" BORDER=0
	HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320 ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=4 VSPACE=1></A>

<BR><A NAME="goblet">&nbsp;</A> The near door opened onto a small chamber,
where a rough hewn tunnel led deeper into the mountain. A pile of ruined
tapestries and cloth lay on one side of the room, exactly as Mystical had seen
in the mind of the giant. Haer searched through the pile while everyone else
stood guard against anything that might emerge from the tunnel. He found a
battered silver goblet (its twin was stashed in Haer's pouch before anyone else
saw it), a gold chain clasping a small ruby, and a silver mirror framed with
fine hardwood. None of these items was magical.

<P>&nbsp; The entire mansion had been explored. The only place left to look for
Desatysso and information concerning the Devourer was the tunnel leading deep
into the mountain. The tunnel was roughly fifteen feet tall and ten feet wide.
A few feet from the entrance a side tunnel branched. This second tunnel was
much smaller, roughly eight feet high, and clearly too small for a seventeen
foot giant to traverse. This was the secret place Mystical had seen in the
giant's memory. Having finished checking every door in the mansion carefully
for traps, Haer walked into the side tunnel with nary a care in the world. The
pressure plate in the floor triggered the far wall to slam across the tunnel,
crushing Haer and knocking Kurik about. Haer saw his life pass before his eyes
and felt pain beyond description as if a rib had pierced his heart and he would
die within six rounds. Fortunately it was just his imagination; after
expenditure of a Fate point and a more reasonable critical roll by the GM he
merely had a few cracked ribs.

<P><A NAME="wine">&nbsp;</A> Kahlen healed Haer's broken bones, and the edges
of the pressure plate were chalked so as to more easily avoid it. The room
beyond held a wine cellar, with racks floor to ceiling holding fine wines from
the surrounding countryside. The most recent vintage was twenty seven years
prior, though some were far older. There were 87 bottles altogether. They would
not all fit in Haer's bag of holding, so a dozen of the best were taken. The
rest went into Kurik's tithing bag, which magically transports anything placed
within to a room at the temple of Pandeos.

<P>&nbsp; On the way back out of the room Haer fumbled a maneuver roll,
tripped, and triggered the damn trap again. This second time merely broke his
leg, which Kahlen mended. The rest of the party secretly vowed to find a better
thief.

<P>&nbsp;
