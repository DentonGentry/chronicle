he desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>That thought kept repeating through Ferranifer's mind, even as she learned
to control the awkwardness of this new halfling body.

<P>The desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>Even as she discovered that those short, pudgy fingers she now despised
were extremely dextrous, with a well-developed sense of touch approaching
that of her former vampiric body, the thirst for revenge against those
who had dared defy Acerak gnawed at her.

<P>The desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>Ferranifer had even attempted to catalog the contents of the voluminous Bag
of Holding, though she gave up the effort after some of the thiefly equipment
it held proved dangerous, slashing her hand badly. Kahlen healed the damage
with only a quizzical nod.

<P>The desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>The bag at the base of the stairs bore the mark of the Black Academy. It
also bore Drake's mark. Drake was an instructor at the Black Academy. Revealing
nothing of the rage boiling within her, she carefully placed the bottle of
"Corpse dust, Acerak" in the Bag of Holding, that she might restore it to its
rightful place on her return to the Prime. Drakes ashes, by contrast, would be
scattered to the wind.

<P>The desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>Her first chance to exact revenge came at the tower of the emerald
spiders. She still possessed the knowledge of her previous incarnation as a
necromancer and vampire, including spells to manipulate and control the undead.
Taking control of five spiders, she directed them during the battle in a
coordinated attack against Rosvenir. Unfortunately the spiders were too weak
to be of much use, and were easily defeated by the party.

<P>The desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>However, the battle with the spiders proved valuable, for it provided the
final clue to the mystery of Kurik's condition. None of the other party members
seemed to have noticed it, but Ferranifer knew the signs. He had not been
eating much from the party's communal cooking. Kahlen's spells of healing were
becoming less effective on him. She hadn't put the clues together until
the battle with the spiders.

<P>The desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>During the battle Rosvenir activated the Wand of Days, bathing the spiders
and the immobilized Kurik in the brightest sunlight. Ferranifer instinctively
cringed back, fearful of the damage which her vampiric body would have
sustained. Perhaps that is why she noticed it: Kurik was smoldering. The burn
damage he suffered was not from the spiders. Kurik was a vampire.

<P>The desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>Ferranifer did not know that Kurik had <A
HREF="../h4/index.html">disappeared</A> during the party's trek through the
Great Swamp, nor of his sudden <A
HREF="../h5/index.html#kurik">reappearance</A> at the Black Academy. However,
she did know that XXXXXXX, a vampire and an instructor at the Academy, had
disappeared several days before her own <A
HREF="../h6/index.html#ferranifer">defeat</A>. She could therefore only guess
that XXXXX had captured Kurik, Embraced him as a vampire, but then been
destroyed by the paladin. Though it was extremely rare for an elder vampire to
be defeated by a newly created vampire, it was not unknown. The elder's control
of his creations is by no means absolute.

<P>Ferranifer did not understand how Kurik still held the favor of Pandeos.
He was able to Repel the <A HREF="../h8/index.html#wight">wight</A> in the
library, and his spells of blessing and protection were as strong as ever.
This meant he was still behaving as a Paladin, and had to be treated carefully.

<P>The desecrators of the Tomb must pay.

<P>For the first time since taking over this hairy body, things were looking
up. The beginning of a plan began to take shape. She could gain the favor
of Acerak, her deity, by destroying this group of interlopers. She would
become a vampire again with Kurik's help, willing or no. Things were
definately looking up.
