s the walls of the Tomb dissolved before his eyes, Haer felt an unwelcome
tugging at the corners of his mind. During the interminable time travelling
from one plane to the next, the presence grew stronger and more forceful.
As the misty sky of Moil coalesced into view, the tugging had become a
rending, tearing Haer's consciousness from his body. As the party examined
Acerak's poem, a new consciousness was taking stock of its new body.
<BR>&nbsp; This new body was strange and misshapen compared to the old. The
legs were short, the arms weak, and the senses dull compared to the glorious
creature it had once been. The otherworldly senses it had once possessed
were nowhere to be found. The new body was also quite hairy, and it itched.

<BR>&nbsp; Having cheated death not once, but twice, the being that was now
Haer Groanagin was understandably elated. Having enchanted the Amulet to act as
a vessel for the soul, it had bided its time and gathered strength until the
opportunity arose to take over a new body. For the first several days in Moil
it took stock of its surroundings, and made plans. Its situation was grim
indeed. This adventuring party had travelled to another plane of existence,
with no obvious means back to the Prime. Worse, they had desecreated the Tomb
and the sacred remains of the mighty Acerak.

<BR>&nbsp; Ferranifer vowed that the desecrators of the Tomb would
pay dearly for their sacriledge.
