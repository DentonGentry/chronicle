<BR><PRE><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS, Arial">Dearest Kahlen,
<P>&nbsp; HIDE THIS NOTE! DON'T READ IT ALOUD!
<P>&nbsp; I am dazed and confused, and only beginning to recover my wits.
However, I've recovered enough to know that it isn't safe for me to return.
You must compose yourself, and give no outward indication of what you are
about to read... Kurik is a Vampire. I don't know how it happened, or when,
but he is now an Undead creature awaiting his chance to destroy his former
comrades.

<P>&nbsp; I discovered this quite by accident. I wasn't fast enough in raising the
alarm, and Kurik, sensing my turmoil, cast a domination spell on me before
I could act. I've been trapped since then, a slave to his will.

<P>&nbsp; Yesterday Kurik sent me down the hallway and channeled spells through
me with which to attack all of you. Something happened, perhaps one of the
spells he channeled, which broke his control of me. I staggered back, and
knew that I was only a heartbeat away from re-enslavement. So I ran
through the archway, beyond which I hoped his magic could not reach. It
appears I was right.

<P>&nbsp; I'm afraid, Kahlen. I don't want to fall under his power again, but I
had to warn you somehow. Carefully, warn the rest of the party, for the
Vampire surely intends to take you one by one unawares. He must be
stopped!
